Various sources of user's logs can be utilized in remodeling, adapting, and personalizing pretrained models to improve the quality of service. We propose a system that can support store/retrieve data and process them in a scalable manner on top of Samsung' big data infrastructure. An automatic speech recognition (ASR) service such as Samsung's S-Voice, Apple's SIRI is one of the representative examples. Recently advances in ASR married with big data technologies drive more personalized services in many areas of services. A speaker adaptation is now a well-accepted technology that requires huge computation cost in creating a personalized acoustic model and corresponding language model over several billions of Samsung product users. We implement a personalized and scalable ASR system powered by the big data infrastructure which brings data-driven personalized opportunities to voice-enabled services such as voice-to-text transcriber, voice-enabled web search in a peta bytes scale. We verify the feasibility of speaker adaptation based on 107 testers' recordings and obtain about 10% of recognition accuracy. An optimal set of performance optimization is suggested to have the best performance such as workflow compaction, file compression, best file system selection among several distributed file systems.",

                "abstract": "Big data systems are becoming pervasive. They are distributed systems that include redundant processing nodes, replicated storage, and frequently execute on a shared 'cloud' infrastructure. For these systems, design-time predictions are insufficient to assure runtime performance in production. This is due to the scale of the deployed system, the continually evolving workloads, and the unpredictable quality of service of the shared infrastructure. Consequently, a solution for addressing performance requirements needs sophisticated runtime observability and measurement. Observability gives real-time insights into a system's health and status, both at the system and application level, and provides historical data repositories for forensic analysis, capacity planning, and predictive analytics. Due to the scale and heterogeneity of big data systems, significant challenges exist in the design, customization and operations of observability capabilities. These challenges include economical creation and insertion of monitors into hundreds or thousands of computation and data nodes, efficient, low overhead collection and storage of measurements (which is itself a big data problem), and application-aware aggregation and visualization. In this paper we propose a reference architecture to address these challenges, which uses a model-driven engineering toolkit to generate architecture-aware monitors and application-specific visualizations.",

                "abstract": "Big data is a broad term for large, dynamic, and complex data sets that have brought great challenges to be addressed by traditional software systems. It has also demanded advanced software architectures (i.e., the big data software architectures) prepared to deal with the continuous expansion of the volume of data as well as to take advantage of new technologies for big data context. However, the main characteristics, basic requirements, and modules and organization of big data architectures are not still widely known. Besides that, no detailed overview about them is available. The main contribution of this paper is to present the state of the art related to big data software architectures; for this, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study. As results, an essential set of eight requirements for big data architectures was identified, besides a collection of five modules that are fundamental to adequately enable the data flow. We also intend these results can guide architects in the development of software systems for this new challenging scenario of big data management.",

The challenge of data retrieval are the improvement of retrieval accuracy and retrieval speed. Aiming at the demand of big data platform for efficient data retrieval, an efficient optimized strategy is proposed. We found when the primary key query is used, the query response can be quick. However, when using a non-primary key query, the cache table needs to be comprehensively scanned and the longer response delay may be induced. This paper proposes a secondary index based on Solr to increase the accuracy of information retrieval and the quality of user experience. Then a cache-heat evaluation algorithm categorizes data according to access frequency to reduce query latency. Moreover, an index optimization method based on memory cache updates the cache to save space and enhance utilization. The experiments and simulation demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively improves the big data retrieval.",

A common approach to handling big data is to divide and distribute the processing job to a cluster of machines. Ideally, a course that teaches students how to work with big data would provide students access to a cluster for hands-on practice. However, a cluster of physical, on-premise machines may be prohibitively expensive, particularly at smaller institutions with smaller budgets.In this report, we summarize our experiences developing and using a virtual cluster in a big data mining and analytics course at a small private liberal arts college. A single moderately-sized server hosts a cluster of virtual machines, which run the popular Apache Hadoop system. The virtual cluster gives students hands-on experience and costs less than an equal number of physical machines. It is also easily constructed and reconfigured. We describe our implementation, analyze its performance characteristics, and compare costs with physical clusters and the Amazon Elastic MapReduce cloud service. We summarize our use of the virtual cluster in the classroom and show student feedback.",

                "abstract": "Big Data projects often require data from several sources to be integrated before they can be used for analysis. Once data have been integrated, they allow more detailed analysis that would otherwise not be possible. Accordingly, recent years have seen an increasing interest in techniques that facilitate the integration of data from diverse sources. Whenever data about individuals, or otherwise sensitive data, are to be integrated across organizations, privacy and confidentiality have to be considered. Domains where privacy preservation during data integration is of importance include business collaborations, health research, national censuses, the social sciences, crime and fraud detection, and homeland security. Increasingly, applications in these domains require data from diverse sources (both internal and external to an organization) to be integrated.Consequently, in the past decade, various techniques have been developed that aim to facilitate data integration without revealing any private or confidential information about the databases and records that are integrated. These techniques either provably prevent leakage of any private information, or they provide some empirical numerical measure of the risk of disclosure of private information.In the first part of this presentation we provide a background on data integration, and illustrate the importance of preserving privacy during data integration with several application scenarios. We then given an overview of the main concepts and techniques that have been developed to facilitate data integration in such ways that no private or confidential information is being revealed. We focus on privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL), where so far most research has been conducted. We describe the basic protocols used in PPRL, and several key technologies employed in these protocols. Finally, we discuss the challenges privacy poses to data integration in the era of Big Data, and we discuss directions and opportunities in this research area.",

Insights into internal and external network traffic is of high importance for understanding specific data flows regarding storage accesses, firewall configurations, and the scheduling of batch jobs on clusters for computing/analysis of data. However, wide adoptions of federated storage, the handling of numerous job on many-core nodes, or the execution of job pilots inside the batch system complicate current data stream monitoring attempts. Therefore, the rising complexity requires new approaches to extend available solutions. As existing batch system monitoring and related system monitoring tools do not support measurements at batch job level, a new tool has been developed and put into operation at the Grid Ka data and computing centre at KIT for monitoring continuous data streams. Obtained results can for example be used to realise an optimisation of LAN/WAN setups based on measured data flows to adapt to the actual needs. This paper describes the current approach being implemented at the Grid Ka batch cluster and presents first analysis results showing the significance of measurements. The described approach is consecutively applied to the context of computing for high-energy physics.",

Understanding what factors cause higher crime is critical for policy makers in their efforts to reduce crime and increase citizens' life quality. We tackle a fundamental problem in our paper: crime rate inference at the neighborhood level. Traditional approaches have used demographics and geographical influences to estimate crime rates in a region. With the fast development of positioning technology and prevalence of mobile devices, a large amount of modern urban data have been collected and such big data can provide new perspectives for understanding crime. In this paper, we used large-scale Point-Of-Interest data and taxi flow data in the city of Chicago, IL in the USA. We observed significantly improved performance in crime rate inference compared to using traditional features. Such an improvement is consistent over multiple years. We also show that these new features are significant in the feature importance analysis.",

Using focus group interviews followed by survey methodology, the authors examine the perception and usage of Big Data, from the perspective of micro-firm managers/owners. The results suggest that a combination of factors affect how micro-firms adopt/accept Big Data technologies including: perception of Big Data as a source for developing the business, uncertainty regarding return-on-investment, and awareness of the opportunities that Big Data can deliver. This study extends the literature on Big Data by offering a contemporary perspective of micro-firm managers/owners who face the challenge of assessing how and where they could innovate their business model with regard to Big Data.",

Data in social networks however can be massive, requiring scalable Big Data architecture. Conversely, research in Big Data needs the volume and velocity of social media data for testing its scalability. Not only so, appropriate data processing and mining of acquired datasets involve complex issues in the variety, veracity, and variability of the data, after which visualisation must occur before we can see fruition in our efforts. This extended abstract presents topical, multimodal, and longitudinal social media datasets from the integration of various scalable open source technologies. The full article details the process that led to the discovery of social information landscapes within the Twitter social network, highlighting the experience of dealing with social media datasets, using a funneling approach so that data becomes manageable.",

The challenges of these distributed and parallel data processing systems include heterogeneous network communication, a mix of storage, memory, and computing devices, and common failures of communication and devices. Particular challenges with big data systems include the variety and volume of data that place previously unseen stresses on distributed computing systems. Experimentation using production-quality hardware and software and realistic data is required to understand system tradeoffs. At the same time, experimental evaluation has challenges, including access to hardware resources at scale, robust workload characterization, data characterization, configuration management of software and systems, and sometimes insidious optimization issues around the mix of software stacks or hardware/software resource allocation. In this talk we present a number of the research challenges when experimentation is used as a tool for the performance evaluation of big data systems, some approaches to solutions, and open questions for this area.",

Data in social networks however can be massive, requiring scalable Big Data architecture. Conversely, research in Big Data needs the volume and velocity of social media data for testing its scalability. Not only so, appropriate data processing and mining of acquired datasets involve complex issues in the variety, veracity, and variability of the data, after which visualisation must occur before we can see fruition in our efforts. This article presents topical, multimodal, and longitudinal social media datasets from the integration of various scalable open source technologies. The article details the process that led to the discovery of social information landscapes within the Twitter social network, highlighting the experience of dealing with social media datasets, using a funneling approach so that data becomes manageable. The article demonstrated the feasibility and value of using scalable open source technologies for acquiring massive, connected datasets for research in the social sciences.",

Data Analytics allows the user to analyze the unusable data to make a faster and better decision. The Latest supply chain professionals are suffused with data, which provokes various new ways of thoughts regarding how the data are produced, ordered, controlled and analyzed. Data Quality in Supply-Chain Management is used to monitor and control the data. This paper presents the knowledge infrastructure about trends in big data analytics. Big Data can also be given as an all-encompassing term for any collection of data sets so large or complex that it becomes difficult to process using traditional data processing applications. The challenges include examination, confine, extent, exploration, sharing, storage, relocate, and visualization and privacy infringement. The Big Data have their application in various fields like in Tourism, Climate Research and many other fields.",

Initial insights pointed to large and complex amalgamations of different fields, techniques and tools. Above all, BD as a research field and as a business tool found to be under developing and is fraught with many challenges. The intention here in this research is to develop an adoption model of BD that could detect key success predictors. The research finds a great interest and optimism about BD value that fueled this current buzz behind this novel phenomenon. Like any disruptive innovation, its assimilation in organizations oppressed with many challenges at various contextual levels. BD would provide different advantages to organizations that would seriously consider all its perspectives alongside its lifecycle in the pre-adoption or adoption or implementation phases. The research attempts to delineate the different facets of BD as a technology and as a management tool highlighting different contributions, implications and recommendations. This is of great interest to researchers, professional and policy makers.",

Finding innovative approaches to support big data analysis has become a priority as both the research community and the industry are trying to make use of these huge amounts of available data. In this paper we introduce a new approach to enhance the overall big data analysis performance. The approach calls for utilizing data set replication, parallel download, and parallel processing over multiple compute nodes. The main concept calls for simultaneously parallelizing the download of the data (in partitions) from multiple replicated sites to multiple compute nodes that will also perform the analysis in parallel. Then the results are given to the client that requested the analysis.",

Education in particular is changing dramatically with the use of online resources and courses that generate large streams of data. In this special session, we ask: What research questions in computer science education can be explored using big data? And how can computer science education researchers apply big data analysis to support education in other disciplines? To answer these and related questions, we focus in this special interactive session on how computer science education research can be promoted by integrating big data into the research process.",

These systems are designed to analyze data sets of high volume with high data ingest rates and short response times executing complex data analysis algorithms on data that does not adhere to relational data models. As these big data systems differ from standard relational database systems with respect to data and workloads, the traditional benchmarks used by the database community are insufficient. In this paper, we describe initial solutions and challenges with respect to big data generation, methods for creating realistic, privacy-aware, and arbitrarily scalable data sets, workloads, and benchmarks from real world data. We will in particular discuss why we feel that workloads currently discussed in the testing and benchmarking community do not capture the real complexity of big data and highlight several research challenges with respect to massively-parallel data generation and data characterization.",

                "abstract": "Background: For health promotion, recognition of risk factors that may modify health needs is necessary, and people then have the opportunity to change their behavior if they are aware of the risk factors. Big data analysis of health data is emerging as a new trend in research that may lead to discovery of unknown facts, and visualization of data is a convenient way in which to understand the characteristics of the data. This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) as the basis to construct a visualization model for disease trajectory analysis.Methods: The NHIRD, which includes inpatient expenditure by admission (DD) and ambulatory care expenditure by visit (CD) data, was used in this study. We analyzed the medical care of patients, such as medications, surgery, medical expenditure and total length of stay, and calculated the number of patients who suffered other diseases within the next 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. A Sankey diagram was employed to show the disease trajectory. Based on data analytics, we constructed a system that helps the user to easily understand the disease trajectory.System implementation: The system includes two panels, a user input panel and an output panel. Using the input panel, the user can input basic information, such as gender, age, date and the queried disease. Based on user input and analytical models, the system will show the detailed trajectory for each queried disease, such as medical expenditure, medications and total length of stay in hospital, and uses Sankey diagrams to show the disease trajectory.Conclusions: This study constructed a visualization system based on analysis of the NHIRD. The Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare, constructed the Health Bank, which contains health data of all individuals. This method may enable prediction of the risks of diseases in the future.",

Given the extensive and effective use of systems incorporating Big Data in many application scenarios, these systems have become a key component in the broad landscape of database systems. This fact creates the need to integrate the study of Big Data Management Systems as part of the computing curricula. This paper presents well-structured guidelines to perform this integration by describing the important types of Big Data systems and demonstrating how each type of system can be integrated into the curriculum. A key contribution of this paper is the description of an array of course resources, e.g., virtual machines, sample projects, and in-class exercises, and how these resources support the learning outcomes and enable a hands-on experience with Big Data technologies.",

Then, the Master, Worker, and MiddleWare layers in the framework, and the development structure of a DCBV framework are designed. The task allocation and recovery strategy, message passing and communication mode, and fault tolerance processing are discussed. Finally, to calculate and verify parameters such as the average shortest path of the framework and shorten calculation time, an improved accurate shortest path algorithm, the N-SPFA algorithm, is proposed. Under different datasets, the node calculation and performance of the N-SPFA algorithm are explored. The algorithm is compared with four approximate shortest-path algorithms: Combined Link and Attribute (CLA), Lexicographic Breadth First Search (LBFS), Approximate algorithm of shortest path length based on center distance of area division (CDZ), and Hub Vertex of area and Core Expressway (HEA-CE). The results show that when the number of CPU threads is 4, the computation time of the DCBV framework is the shortest (514.63 ms). As the number of CPU cores increases, the overall computation time of the framework decreases gradually. For every 2 additional CPU cores, the number of tasks increases by 1. When the number of Worker nodes is 8 and the number of nodes is 1, the computation time of the framework is the shortest (210,979 ms), and the IO statistics data increase with the increase of Worker nodes. When the datasets are Undirected01 and Undirected02, the computation time of the N-SPFA algorithm is the shortest, which is 4520 ms and 7324 ms, respectively. However, the calculation time in the ca-condmat_undirected dataset is 175,292 ms, and the performance is slightly worse. Overall, however, the performance of the N-SPFA and SPFA algorithms is good. Therefore, the two algorithms are combined. For networks with less complexity, the computational scale coefficient of the SPFA algorithm can be set to 0.06, and for general networks, 0.2. When compared with other algorithms in different datasets, the pretreatment time, average query time, and overall query time of N-SPFA algorithm are the shortest, being 49.67 ms, 5.12 ms, and 94,720 ms, respectively. The accuracy (1.0087) and error rate (0.024) are also the best. In conclusion, voluntary computing can be applied to the processing of big data, which has a good reference significance for the distributed analysis of large-scale complex networks.",

Over the past few years, several applications and systems have developed to use cluster, cloud or grid computing to manage big data so as to support data science, big data analytics, as well as knowledge discovery and data mining. In this paper, we focus on distributed big data management. Specifically, we present our method for big data representation and management of distributed big data from social networks. We represent such big graph data in distributed settings so as to support big data mining of frequently occurring patterns from social networks.",

Such a classical setting is not always appropriate for real-world applications when data instances are of high dimensionality or the access to it is expensive to acquire the full set of attributes/features. To address this limitation, we investigate the problem of Online Feature Selection (OFS) in which the online learner is only allowed to maintain a classifier involved a small and fixed number of features. The key challenge of Online Feature Selection is how to make accurate prediction using a small and fixed number of active features. This is in contrast to the classical setup of online learning where all the features are active and can be used for prediction. We address this challenge by studying sparsity regularization and truncation techniques. Specifically, we present an effective algorithm to solve the problem, give the theoretical analysis, and evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms for online feature selection on several public datasets. We also demonstrate the application of our online feature selection technique to tackle real-world problems of big data mining, which is significantly more scalable than some well-known batch feature selection algorithms. The encouraging results of our experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed techniques for large-scale applications.",

We study boundedly evaluable queries under a form of access constraints, when their evaluation cost is determined by the queries and constraints only. While it is undecidable to determine whether FO queries are boundedly evaluable, we show that for several classes of FO queries, the bounded evaluability problem is decidable. We also provide characterization and effective syntax for their boundedly evaluable queries.When a query Q is not boundedly evaluable, we study two approaches to approximately answering Q under access constraints. (1) We search for upper and lower envelopes of Q that are boundedly evaluable and warrant a constant accuracy bound. (2) We instantiate a minimum set of variables (parameters) in Q such that the specialized query is boundedly evaluable. We study problems for deciding the existence of envelopes and bounded specialized queries, and establish their complexity for various classes of FO queries.",

In the current era of big data, data governance has gradually become an important means for enterprises to make intelligent decisions, helping enterprises to occupy a favorable position in a highly competitive market environment. This paper briefly describes the current situation of enterprise big data governance, and analyzes the problems of current data governance from the perspectives of enterprise management and data itself. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes several suggestions and strategies from the perspectives of organization and management system construction, construction of a data standard system, improve the level of data quality management, data technology surpport, etc. Fully combining the advanced theories and methods of domestic data governance, this paper designs a data governance framework from the perspective of data application and innovation. The framework includes supervision and control modules, data governance staff organization modules, application and service modules, and data processing and integration modules. And the framework is applied to the data governance of electric power enterprises, which has important reference significance and value for enterprises to carry out data governance.",

However, the study of the existing map-matching algorithm technique is mainly for navigation. In order to analyze large amounts of GPS trajectories on a server, issues of the speed and performance of the system exist. The purpose of this study is to utilize a map-matching system using HBase, which is a distributed NoSQL DB in a Hadoop ecosystem. We defined the table specification of HBase for mounting the digital map and proposed and implemented the method for analysis with a map-matching algorithm. In this paper, we present the map-matching methodology using the NoSQL DB of Hadoop ecosystem for analyzing GPS trajectory.",

We first survey existing approaches on vulnerability analysis of critical infrastructures and discuss relevant systems and tools aligned with our vision. Next, we present a generic system architecture and discuss challenges including: (1) Constructing and managing a CI network-of-networks graph, (2) Performing analytic operations at scale, and (3) Interactive visualization of analytic output to generate meaningful insights. We argue that this architecture acts as a baseline to realize a national-scale network based vulnerability analysis system.",

This step is time consuming and error prone, while the produced artifacts (code, intermediate datasets) are usually not of scientific value. In the recent years, Apache Spark has emerged as a solid foundation for data science and has taken the big data analytics domain by storm. We believe that the primitives exposed by Apache Spark can help software engineering researchers create and share reproducible, high-performance data analysis pipelines.In our technical briefing, we discuss how researchers can profit from Apache Spark, through a hands-on case study.",

                "abstract": "An increasing number of product pages are available from thousands of web sources, each page associated with a product, containing its attributes and one or more product identifiers. The sources provide overlapping information about the products, using diverse schemas, making web-scale integration extremely challenging. In this paper, we take advantage of the opportunity that sources publish product identifiers to perform big data linkage across sources at the beginning of the data integration pipeline, before schema alignment. To realize this opportunity, several challenges need to be addressed: identifiers need to be discovered on product pages, made difficult by the diversity of identifiers; the main product identifier on the page needs to be identified, made difficult by the many related products presented on the page; and identifiers across pages need to beresolved, made difficult by the ambiguity between identifiers across product categories. We present our RaF (Redundancy as Friend) solution to the problem of big data linkage for product specification pages, which takes advantage of the redundancy of identifiers at a global level, and the homogeneity of structure and semantics at the local source level, to effectively and efficiently link millions of pages of head and tail products across thousands of head and tail sources. We perform a thorough empirical evaluation of our RaF approach using the publicly available Dexter dataset consisting of 1.9M product pages from 7.1k sources of 3.5k websites, and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.",

                "abstract": "The currentWorld-WideWeb enables an easy, instant access to a vast amount of online information. However, the content in theWeb is typically for human consumption, and is not tailored for machine processing. The Semantic Web is hence intended to establish a machine-understandable Web, and is currently also used in many other domains and not only in the Web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed a number of standards around this vision. Among them is the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is used as the data model of the Semantic Web. The W3C has also defined SPARQL as the RDF query language, RIF as the rule language, and the ontology languages RDFS and OWL to describe schemas of RDF. The usage of common ontologies increases interoperability between heterogeneous data sets, and the proprietary ontologies with the additional abstraction layer facilitate the integration of these data sets. Therefore, we can argue that the Semantic Web is ideally designed to work in heterogeneous Big Data environments.We define Semantic Big Data as the intersection of Semantic Web data and Big Data. There are masses of Semantic Web data freely available to the public - thanks to the efforts of the linked data initiative. According to http://stats.lod2.eu/ the current freely available Semantic Web data is approximately 150 billion triples in over 2,800 datasets, many of which are accessible via SPARQL query servers called SPARQL endpoints. Everyone can submit SPARQL queries to SPARQL endpoints via a standardized protocol, where the queries are processed on the datasets of the SPARQL endpoints and the query results are sent back in a standardized format. Hence, not only Semantic Big Data is freely available, but also distributed execution environments for Semantic Big Data are freely accessible. This makes the Semantic Web an ideal playground for Big Data research.The goal of this workshop is to bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners to address the challenges and report and exchange the research findings in Semantic Big Data, including new approaches, techniques and applications, make substantial theoretical and empirical contributions to, and significantly advance the state of the art of Semantic Big Data.",

The results provided by the systems are predictive models with the ability to predict some weather-related variables, such as temperature and rainfall. The system has been validated from a triple perspective (usability, experts’ validation, and performance assessment), obtaining satisfactory results. This paper aims to be a brief guide for authors who intend to developed similar systems either in the meteorological field or other domains generating big amounts of data.",

In Big Data environments, Hive is used as a distributed storage mechanism that provides data warehousing capabilities. Its data schemas are defined attending to the analytical requirements specified by the users. In this work, multidimensional data models are used as the source of those requirements, allowing the automatic transformation of a multidimensional schema into a tabular schema suited to be implemented in Hive. To achieve this objective, a set of rules is proposed and tested in a demonstration case, showing the applicability and usefulness of the proposed approach.",

These operators allow programmers to write proprietary functionalities on top of a relational query skeleton. However, achieving effective query optimization for such languages is extremely challenging since the optimizer needs to understand data dependencies induced by UDOs. SCOPE, the query language from Microsoft, allows for hand coded declarations of UDO data dependencies. Unfortunately, most programmers avoid using this facility since writing and maintaining the declarations is tedious and error-prone. In this work, we designed and implemented two sound and robust static analyses for computing UDO data dependencies. The analyses can detect what columns of an input table are never used or pass-through a UDO unchanged. This information can be used to significantly improve execution of SCOPE scripts. We evaluate our analyses on thousands of real-world queries and show we can catch many unused and pass-through columns automatically without relying on any manually provided declarations.",

For demand-oriented energy services, the primary objectives of are set to reduce the cost or improve the energy efficiency on the consumption side. The association of a Hadoop-based large-scale distributed system with SCADA has engendered various applications using energy Big Data. Especially, the integration of Spark with Hadoop has promoted the development of demand-oriented energy services for Big Data with growing necessities in the industry. In this paper, we investigate demand-oriented energy Big Data services using a Hadoop-based large-scale distributed system platform for district heating as a case. Moreover, we introduce a social energy Big Data service which can ameliorate energy control and management with the demonstration in district heating.",

However, there are some problems in the traditional joint training model of graduate students, such as low efficiency, conflict of objectives of cooperative subjects, a mismatch between supply and demand of cooperative entities, and so on. The big data technology has brought new opportunities and challenges to the joint training of graduate students by university-industry cooperation institutions. Based on analyzing the connotation and characteristics of the big data era, the paper points out that the arrival of the big data era can improve the information integration efficiency of university-industry cooperation institutions, optimize the traditional joint training model of graduate students, and provide an effective evaluation mechanism of educational quality for university-industry cooperation institutions. At the same time, the paper discusses the difficulties of data collection and disclosure of data privacy faced by university-industry cooperative education in the big data era. The paper also discusses how to deal with the challenges from the perspective of the government, colleges and universities, scientific research institutions and enterprises.",

Based on the computer data structure–tree, we construct a non-negative integer inheritance decimal tree. The nodes on the decimal tree correspond to non-negative integers. We further define the Collatz-leaf node (corresponding to the Collatz-leaf integer) on the decimal tree. The Collatz-leaf nodes satisfy the strong Collatz conjecture. Through mathematical derivation, we prove that the Collatz-leaf node (Collatz-leaf integer) has the characteristics of inheritance. With computer large numbers and big data calculation, we conclude that all nodes at a depth of 800 are Collatz-leaf nodes. Thus, we prove that the strong Collatz conjecture is true, and therefore the Collatz conjecture must also be true. For any positive integer N greater than 1, the minimum number of Collatz transforms from N to 1 is log2 N, the maximum number of Collatz transforms is 800 * (N-1). The non-negative integer inheritance decimal tree proposed and constructed in this paper also can be used for proofs of other mathematical problems.",

However, many big data components face many problems in actual industrial production, make the construction and maintenance cost of the big data platform high. Although there is an automated deployment platform for big data components on the market, it lacks comprehensive management and monitoring functions for the entire big data platform, resulting in users not being able to fully pay attention to all aspects of the big data platform, and the service and resource management is not flexible enough. Therefore, we have designed and implemented an open componentized big data platform, so that users can not only easily install and deploy big data components in the cluster, but also manage the resources and services of big data components conveniently and flexibly. Besides, complete monitoring information also provides the necessary guarantee for the stable running of the big data platform. The open componentized big data platform provides users with one-stop big data services.",

Endeavors of this kind include projects such as DBpedia, Freebase, KnowItAll, ReadTheWeb, and YAGO. These projects provide automatically constructed knowledge bases of facts about named entities, their semantic classes, and their mutual relationships. They contain millions of entities and hundreds of millions of facts about them. Such world knowledge in turn enables cognitive applications and knowledge-centric services like disambiguating natural-language text, semantic search for entities and relations in Web and enterprise data, and entity-oriented analytics over unstructured contents. Prominent examples of how knowledge bases can be harnessed include the Google Knowledge Graph and the IBM Watson question answering system. This tutorial presents state-of-the-art methods, recent advances, research opportunities, and open challenges along this avenue of knowledge harvesting and its applications. Particular emphasis will be on the twofold role of knowledge bases for big-data analytics: using scalable distributed algorithms for harvesting knowledge from Web and text sources, and leveraging entity-centric knowledge for deeper interpretation of and better intelligence with Big Data.",

On the other hand, for data analytics in a broad sense, there are plenty of non-DBMS tools including statistical languages, matrix packages, generic data mining programs and large-scale parallel systems, being the main technology for big data analytics. Such large-scale systems are mostly based on the Hadoop distributed file system and MapReduce. Thus it would seem a DBMS is not a good technology to analyze big data, going beyond SQL queries, acting just as a reliable and fast data repository. In this survey, we argue that is not the case, explaining important research that has enabled analytics on large databases inside a DBMS. However, we also argue DBMSs cannot compete with parallel systems like MapReduce to analyze web-scale text data. Therefore, each technology will keep influencing each other. We conclude with a proposal of long-term research issues, considering the \"big data analytics\" trend.",

                "abstract": "The current World-Wide Web enables an easy, instant access to a vast amount of online information. However, the content in the Web is typically for human consumption, and is not tailored for machine processing. The Semantic Web is hence intended to establish a machine-understandable Web, and is currently also used in many other domains and not only in the Web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed a number of standards around this vision. Among them is the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is used as the data model of the Semantic Web. The W3C has also defined SPARQL as the RDF query language, RIF as the rule language, and the ontology languages RDFS and OWL to describe schemas of RDF. The usage of common ontologies increases interoperability between heterogeneous data sets, and the proprietary ontologies with the additional abstraction layer facilitate the integration of these data sets. Therefore, we can argue that the Semantic Web is ideally designed to work in heterogeneous Big Data environments.We define Semantic Big Data as the intersection of Semantic Web data and Big Data. There are masses of Semantic Web data freely available to the public - thanks to the efforts of the linked data initiative. According to http://stats.lod2.eu/ the current freely available Semantic Web data is approximately 90 billion triples in over 3,300 datasets, many of which are accessible via SPARQL query servers called SPARQL endpoints. Everyone can submit SPARQL queries to SPARQL endpoints via a standardized protocol, where the queries are processed on the datasets of the SPARQL endpoints and the query results are sent back in a standardized format. Hence, not only Semantic Big Data is freely available, but also distributed execution environments for Semantic Big Data are freely accessible. This makes the Semantic Web an ideal playground for Big Data research.The goal of this workshop is to bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners to address the challenges and report and exchange the research findings in Semantic Big Data, including new approaches, techniques and applications, make substantial theoretical and empirical contributions to, and significantly advance the state of the art of Semantic Big Data.",

To provide better service to 600 million customers and reduce the cost of IT systems, China Mobile adopted a centralized IT strategy based on cloud computing. The big data issue becomes the most significant challenge to the cloud computing based China Mobile IT structure. This paper presents the China Mobile's big data platform based on the cloud. This platform integrates the big data storage, the development and deployment of big data ETL (Extract, Transfer, Load) and DM (Data Mining) into a unified framework. This big data analysis platform can effectively support the analytical tasks in telecommunications, but it can also help China Mobile provide public cloud computing service. In this paper, we introduce the detailed architecture of China Mobile's platform and discuss its performance.",

Interactive visualisation of this multimodal data, integrating 2D (image and video) and 3D graphics modes, would result in enhanced use. A browser-based context is capable of this integration in a seamless and powerful manner, but faces significant challenges related to data transfer and compression which must be overcome. This paper presents an application designed to harness the power of a hybrid web context while attempting to overcome or compensate for the difficulties of data transfer limitations and rendering power. Results are presented from three, publicly available test datasets, which represent a realistic sample of data recorded on a typical high-budget production set.",

Database researchers and statistical machine learning researchers are centrally involved in the creation of this blend, and research that incorporates perspectives from both databases and machine learning will be of particular value in the bigger picture. This is true both for methodology and for theory. I present highlights of several research initiatives that draw jointly on database and statistical foundations, including work on concurrency control and distributed inference, subsampling, time/data tradeoffs and inference/privacy tradeoffs.",

At the same time, governments have significant fiscal constraints on their ability to address these challenges and opportunities. Through a combination of open government, open data, and civic engagement, however, governments, citizens, civil society groups, and others are reinventing the relationship between governments and the governed by developing crowdsourced and other innovative solutions for community advancement. Underlying this reinvention and innovation is data -- particularly local data about housing, air quality, graduation rates, literacy rates, poverty, disease, and more. And yet, not all communities have the capacity to create, work with, or leverage data at the local level. Using a case study approach in a medium-sized U.S. city, this paper focuses on the issues that smaller communities face when seeking to create local data infrastructures and the extent to which libraries can develop their capabilities, capacity, and abilities to work with community information and data to facilitate community engagement and high-impact, locally relevant analytics.",

In response, systems offer pre-determined behaviors based on heuristics and then expose a large number of configuration parameters for operators to adjust them to their particular infrastructure. Unfortunately, in practice this leads to a substantial manual tuning effort. In this work, we focus on one of the most impactful tuning decisions in big data systems: the number of executor threads. We first show the impact of I/O contention on the runtime of workloads and a simple static solution to reduce the number of threads for I/O-bound phases. We then present a more elaborate solution in the form of self-adaptive executors which are able to continuously monitor the underlying system resources and detect contentions. This enables the executors to tune their thread pool size dynamically at runtime in order to achieve the best performance. Our experimental results show that being adaptive can significantly reduce the execution time especially in I/O intensive applications such as Terasort and PageRank which see a 34% and 54% reduction in runtime.",

                "abstract": "Current technology provides wonderful facilities for operating with extremely vast amounts of data. These facilities are expanding due to capabilities of \"Cloud Computing.\" The developing situation gives rise to the \"Big Data\" concept posing specific engineering and organizational challenges. Big data refers to the rising flood of digital data from many sources, including the sensors, digitizers, scanners, software-based modeling, mobile phones, internet, videos, e-mails, and social network communications. The data type could be texts, geometries, images, videos, sounds, or their combination. Many of such data are directly or indirectly related to geospatial information. In this paper, we suggest to enhance the available information processing resources with a novel software/hardware technique for on-the-fly clusterization of amorphous data from diverse sources. The presented approach is based on the previously developed construction of FuzzyFind Dictionary utilizing the error-correction Golay Code. Realization of this technique requires processing of intensive continuous data streams, which can be effectively implemented using multi-core pipelining with forced interrupts. The objective of this paper is to bring forward a new simple and efficacious tool for one of the most demanding operations of this \"Big Data\" methodology --clustering of diverse information items in a data stream mode. Improving our ability to extract knowledge and insights from large and complex collections of digital data promises to solve some the Nation's most pressing challenges. Furthermore, the paper reveals a parallel between the computational model integrating \"Big Data\" streams and the organization of information processing in the brain. The uncertainties in relation to the considered method of clusterization are moderated due to the idea of the bounded rationality, an approach that does not require a complete exact knowledge for sensible decision-making.",

Its mission is to provide a focal point for the College's capabilities in multidisciplinary data-driven research by coordinating advanced data science research for college scientists and partners, and educating the next generation of data scientists. We surveyed the data-driven research needs at Imperial College London to gain an understanding across all disciplines offered by the College, and analysed the responses to gain insights into scientific and engineering needs for data science research.A clear message is that multidisciplinarity is essential for Big Data and data science research to enable a \"chemistry of sciences\": connecting all disciplines by integrating data. This paper presents our efforts to best understand data-driven research needs in a highly multidisciplinary research-intensive institution and describes our vision for the future of the Data Science Institute at Imperial College London.",

This modular setup allows re-use of components across several different pipelines. However, the interaction of independently tuned pipeline components yields poor end-to-end performance as errors introduced by one component cascade through the whole pipeline, affecting overall accuracy. We propose a novel model for reasoning across components of Big Data Pipelines in a probabilistically well-founded manner. Our key idea is to view the interaction of components as dependencies on an underlying graphical model. Different message passing schemes on this graphical model provide various inference algorithms to trade-off end-to-end performance and computational cost. We instantiate our framework with an efficient beam search algorithm, and demonstrate its efficiency on two Big Data Pipelines: parsing and relation extraction.",

In this paper, we find that the widely-used location based services (LBSs) have accumulated lots of over-the-top (OTT) global positioning system (GPS) data in telco networks, which can be automatically used as training labels for learning accurate MR-based positioning systems. Benefiting from these telco big data, we deploy a context-aware coarse-to-fine regression (CCR) model in Spark/Hadoop-based telco big data platform for city-scale localization of MDs with two novel contributions. First, we design map-matching and interpolation algorithms to encode contextual information of road networks. Second, we build a two-layer regression model to capture coarse-to-fine contextual features in a short time window for improved localization performance. In our experiments, we collect 108 GPS-associated MR records in the centroid of Shanghai city with 12 x 11 square kilometers for 30 days, and measure four important properties of real-world MR data related to localization errors: stability, sensitivity, uncertainty and missing values. The proposed CCR works well under different properties of MR data and achieves a mean error of 110m and a median error of $80m$, outperforming the state-of-art range-based and fingerprinting localization methods.",

                "abstract": "The development of the Edge computing paradigm shifts data processing from centralised infrastructures to heterogeneous and geographically distributed infrastructure. Such a paradigm requires data processing solutions that consider data locality in order to reduce the performance penalties from data transfers between remote (in network terms) data centres. However, existing Big Data processing solutions have limited support for handling data locality and are inefficient in processing small and frequent events specific to Edge environments. This paper proposes a novel architecture and a proof-of-concept implementation for software container-centric Big Data workflow orchestration that puts data locality at the forefront. Our solution considers any available data locality information by default, leverages long-lived containers to execute workflow steps, and handles the interaction with different data sources through containers. We compare our system with Argo workflow and show significant performance improvements in terms of speed of execution for processing units of data using our data locality aware Big Data workflow approach.",

A prototype system of USV big data is established, and a preliminary anomaly detection application based on isolation forest method is developed. The effective anomaly detection results show that the USV big data prototype system and the anomaly detection application is feasible. The establishment of USV big data system is meaningful and the system can provide effective application services.",

Despite the availability of a number of tools and frameworks to assess Linked Data Quality, the output of such tools is not suitable for machine consumption, and thus consumers can hardly compare and rank datasets in the order of fitness for use. This article describes a conceptual methodology for assessing Linked Datasets, and Luzzu; a framework for Linked Data Quality Assessment. Luzzu is based on four major components: (1) an extensible interface for defining new quality metrics; (2) an interoperable, ontology-driven back-end for representing quality metadata and quality problems that can be re-used within different semantic frameworks; (3) scalable dataset processors for data dumps, SPARQL endpoints, and big data infrastructures; and (4) a customisable ranking algorithm taking into account user-defined weights. We show that Luzzu scales linearly against the number of triples in a dataset. We also demonstrate the applicability of the Luzzu framework by evaluating and analysing a number of statistical datasets against a variety of metrics. This article contributes towards the definition of a holistic data quality lifecycle, in terms of the co-evolution of linked datasets, with the final aim of improving their quality.",

Some researchers say Big Data will be even bigger buzzword than the Internet. With fast-growing computing resources, information and knowledge a new digital globe has emerged. Information is being created and stored at a fast rate and is being accessed by a vast range of applications through scientific computing, commercial workloads, and social media. In 2018, over 28 billion devices globally, are connected to the internet. In 2020, more than 50 billion smart appliances will be connected worldwide and internet traffic flow will be 92 times greater than it was in 2005. The usage of such a massive number of connected devices not only increase the data volume but also the velocity of data addition with speed of light on fiber optic and various wireless networks. This fast generation of enormous data creates numerous threats and challenges. There exist various approaches that are addressing issues and challenges of Big Data with the theory of Vs such as 3 V's, 5 V's, 7 V's etc. The objective of this work is to explore and investigate the status of the current Big Data domain. Further, a comprehensive overview of Big Data, its characteristics, opportunities, issues, and challenges have been explored and described with the help of 51 V's. The outcome of this research will help in understanding the Big Data in a systematic way.",

Among the vast amount of MBD research results, despite the bibliometric analysis, it does not provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the cutting-edge trends and developments in MBD research due to the small amount of data and poor timeliness. Therefore, based on the 3353 publications retrieved from Web of Science between 2002 and 2022, this paper performed quantitative, various kinds of cooperative networks, clustering networks, keywords, frontier trends and main path analysis. The conclusions are as follows. (1) MBD research findings are increasing at an even higher rate. (2) Research contribution differs widely between countries and institutions, and is relatively average between authors and journals. (3) MBD research frontiers show a tendency to span a wide range of disciplines and to be strongly associated with Internet technologies. (4) According to the results of the main path analysis, health IoT and medical big data are the hot spots for MBD research.",
