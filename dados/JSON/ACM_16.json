The mining, classification, and recognition of big data in the Internet of Things system are the key links that are widely of concern at present. The artificial neural network is beneficial for multi-dimensional data classification and recognition because of its strong feature extraction and self-learning ability. Pre-training is an effective method to address the gradient diffusion problem in deep neural networks and could result in better generalization. This article focuses on the performance of supervised pre-training that uses labelled data. In particular, this pre-training procedure is a simulation that shows the changes in judgment patterns as they progress from primary to mature within the human brain. In this article, the state-of-the-art of neural network pre-training is reviewed. Then, the principles of the auto-encoder and supervised pre-training are introduced in detail. Furthermore, an extended structure of supervised pre-training is proposed. A set of experiments are carried out to compare the performances of different pre-training methods. These experiments include a comparison between the original and pre-trained networks as well as a comparison between the networks with two types of sub-network structures. In addition, a homemade database is established to analyze the influence of pre-training on the generalization ability of neural networks. Finally, an ordinary convolutional neural network is used to verify the applicability of supervised pre-training.",

The success of any text mining application rests on the quality of the underlying data being analyzed, including both predictive features and outcome labels. In this case study, some focused experiments regarding data quality are used to assess the robustness of Statistical Text Mining (STM) algorithms when applied to clinical progress notes. In particular, the experiments consider the impacts of task complexity (by removing signals), training set size, and target outcome quality. While this research is conducted using a dataset drawn from the medical domain, the data quality issues explored are of more general interest.",

The Team Software ProcessSM (TSPSM) provides a framework that teams use to collect software process data in real time, using a defined disciplined process. This data holds promise for use in software engineering research. We combined data from 109 industrial projects into a database to support performance benchmarking and model development. But is the data of sufficient quality to draw conclusions? We applied various tests and techniques to identify data anomalies that affect the quality of the data in several dimensions. In this paper, we report some initial results of our analysis, describing the amount and the rates of identified anomalies and suspect data, including incorrectness, inconsistency, and credibility. To illustrate the types of data available for analysis, we provide three examples. The preliminary results of this empirical study suggest that some aspects of the data quality are good and the data are generally credible, but size data are often missing.",

Now a days, vast amount of digital data is being gathered from many important areas, including social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter. It is important for us to mine this big data for analysis purpose. One important analysis in this domain is to find key nodes in a social graph which can be the major information spreader. Node centrality measures can be used in many graph applications such as searching and ranking of nodes. Traditional centrality algorithms fail on such huge graphs therefore it is difficult to use these algorithms on big graphs. Traditional centrality algorithms such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality were not designed for such large data. In this paper, we calculate centrality measures for big graphs having huge number of edges and nodes by parallelizing traditional centrality algorithms so that they can be used in an efficient way when the size of graph grows. We use MapReduce and Hadoop to implement these algorithms for parallel and distributed data processing. We present results and anomalies of these algorithms and also show the comparative processing time taken on normal systems and on Hadoop systems.",

The application of big data in the education industry is very prominent. Adding Internet thinking in the education process can enable students to learn relevant knowledge online after class, consolidate knowledge and exercise students' self-learning ability. As the core component of the computer application field, online teaching has outstanding advantages. Learners can talk with famous teachers anytime and anywhere, work out their own learning plans, and eliminate knowledge blind spots. This paper mainly discusses the application of computer big data in Internet learning, and analyzes the application process of computer big data in Internet learning based on the structure level, aiming at using Internet technology to achieve efficient learning.",

Yet big data and big data analytics are leaving some of us feeling a bit more naked than before. This talk will provide some personal observations on privacy today and then outline some research areas where progress is needed to enable society to gain the benefits of analyzing large datasets without giving up more privacy than necessary. Not since the early 1970s, when computing pioneer Willis Ware chaired the committee that produced the initial Fair Information Practice Principles [2] has privacy been so much in the U.S. public eye. Snowden's revelations, as well as a growing awareness that merely living our lives seems to generate an expanding \"digital exhaust.\" Have triggered many workshops and meetings. A national strategy for privacy research is in preparation by a Federal interagency group. The ability to analyze large datasets rapidly and to extract commercially useful insights from them is spawning new industries. Must this industrial growth come at the cost of substantial privacy intrusions?",

The results show that the snow band maintained approximately 12h and its height reached to 500hPa in vertical at yantai. This snow storm event generated owing to the cooperation of the fashionable synchronous circuit and both thermodynamic forging caused by the warm Bohai-sea surface and dynamic forging by the topography. The coast Al front generated owing to the different temperature between Bohai Sea and land and the ageostrophic wind, which brings an obvious increment of local snow fall and whose secondary circulation decide the distribution of snowfall. Meanwhile the weak land break which formatted in night is significant for the formation and maintenance of the selective cloud band.",

Meanwhile, big data technology is gradually improving and achieving a wide range of applications. Big data technology can extract the required effective data from a large amount of messy data and perform statistical analysis. Thereby improving teaching efficiency. The purpose of this article is to study the application of big data technology (ABDT) in the teaching of interpretation and translation (IAT). This article secondly describes the ABDT in the teaching of IAT, and collects and analyzes the teaching data of IAT through big data technology. This article analyzes various difficulties encountered in practical application of oral and written translation teaching through practical research, including difficulties in translation skills, cognitive difficulties in the process of note-taking, and difficulties in lack of professional vocabulary. Finally, according to various application difficulties, relevant coping strategies are proposed to improve the quality of IAT teaching. The experimental research results show that before applying big data technology in teaching, the teaching effects of various indicators are 71.48%, 73.19% and 65.94% respectively. After application, the teaching effects of various indicators are 85.61%, 81.52% and 86.37 respectively. %. From the perspective of the whole day, after applying big data, the teaching effect has been significantly improved.",

Visualization of the results of the algorithm can be illustrated on a geographical map as a model of distribution network. Second, using interpolation algorithms allows us to visualize the problem areas of a region in a model of previously designed network. Such visualizations provide a deep understanding of the properties of a distribution network.",

On the other hand, the event and stream processing community has focused on the velocity of data, producing systems that efficiently operate on streams of data on-the-fly according to pre-deployed processing rules or queries. Several recent works explore the synergy between stream processing and reasoning to fully capture the requirements of modern data intensive applications, thus giving birth to the research domain of stream reasoning.This tutorial paper offers an overview of the theoretical and technological achievements in stream reasoning, highlighting the key benefits and limitations of existing approaches, and discussing the open challenges and the opportunities for future research. The paper mainly targets researchers and practitioners in the area of event and stream processing. The paper aims to stimulate the discussion on stream reasoning and to further promote the integration of reasoning techniques within event and stream processing systems in three ways: (i) by presenting an active research domain, where researchers on event and stream processing can apply their expertise; (ii) by discussing techniques and technologies that can help advancing the state of the art in event and stream processing; (iii) by identifying the open problems in the field of stream reasoning, and drawing attention to promising research directions.",

                "abstract": "The long I/O latency posts significant challenges for many data-intensive applications, such as the emerging big data workloads. Recently, the NVDIMM (Non-Volatile Dual In-line Memory Module) technologies provide a promising solution to this problem. By employing non-volatile NAND flash memory as storage media and connecting them via DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module) slots, the NVDIMM devices are exposed to memory bus so the access latencies due to going through I/O controllers can be significantly mitigated. However, placing NVDIMM on the memory bus introduces new challenges. For instance, by mixing I/O and memory traffic, NVDIMM can cause severe performance degradation on memory-intensive applications. Besides, there exists a speed mismatch between fast memory access and slow flash read/write operations. Moreover, garbage collection (GC) in NAND flash may cause up to several millisecond latency.This paper presents novel, enabling mechanisms that allow NVDIMM to more effectively bridge the I/O performance gap for big data workloads. To address the workload heterogeneity challenge, we develop a scheduling scheme in memory controller to minimize the interference between the native and the I/O-derived memory traffic by exploiting both data access criticality and resource utilization. For NVDIMM controller, several mechanisms are designed to better orchestrate traffic between the memory controller and NAND flash to alleviate the speed discrepancy issue. To mitigate the lengthy GC period, we propose a proactive GC scheme for the NVDIMM controller and flash controller to intelligently synchronize and transfer data involving in forthcoming GC operations. We present detailed evaluation and analysis to quantify how well our techniques fit with the NVDIMM design. Our experimental results show that overall the proposed techniques yield 10%~35% performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline schemes.",

                "abstract": "Intrusive multi-step attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, have plagued enterprises with significant financial losses and are the top reason for enterprises to increase their security budgets. Since these attacks are sophisticated and stealthy, they can remain undetected for years if individual steps are buried in background \"noise.\" Thus, enterprises are seeking solutions to \"connect the suspicious dots\" across multiple activities. This requires ubiquitous system auditing for long periods of time, which in turn causes overwhelmingly large amount of system audit events. Given a limited system budget, how to efficiently handle ever-increasing system audit logs is a great challenge. This paper proposes a new approach that exploits the dependency among system events to reduce the number of log entries while still supporting high-quality forensic analysis. In particular, we first propose an aggregation algorithm that preserves the dependency of events during data reduction to ensure the high quality of forensic analysis. Then we propose an aggressive reduction algorithm and exploit domain knowledge for further data reduction. To validate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on real-world auditing systems using log traces of more than one month. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce the size of system logs and improve the efficiency of forensic analysis without losing accuracy.",

However, factors such as hardware malfunctions, network failures, or cyber-attacks affect data quality and result in inaccurate data generation. Therefore, to facilitate the data usage, we propose a novel 5D-IoT framework for heterogeneous IoT systems that provides uniform data quality assessment with meaningful data descriptions. Based on the quality assessment result, a data consumer can directly access data from any IoT source, which ultimately speeds up the analysis process and helps gain important insights in less time. The framework relies on semantic descriptions of sensor observations and SHACL shapes assessing the quality of such data. Evaluations carried out on real-time data show the added value of such a framework.",

Since the publication of the MapReduce paradigm, a plethora of such systems arose, but although widespread, the capabilities of these systems are still poorly understood and putting them to effective use is often more of an art than a science. As one of the causes for this observation, we identify a lack of theoretical underpinnings for these systems, which makes it hard to understand what the advantages and disadvantages of the particular systems are and which, in addition, complicates the choice of a particular formalism for a particular task. In my PhD thesis, we zoom in on several important aspects of query evaluation using clusters of servers, including coordination and communication, data-skew, load balancing, and data partitioning, and propose a set of elegant and theoretically sound frameworks and theories that help to understand the applicable limitations and trade-offs.",

With the changes of social, economic, financial and legal environment, the financial supervision measures of enterprises need to be adjusted. The arrival of big data era has forced the competition among SMEs to increase, and effective financial internal control can provide necessary guarantee for SMEs to achieve their business development goals. With the rapid economic renewal and social progress, financial management is very important for an enterprise, which holds the lifeblood of an enterprise. Based on this, in the demand of low-carbon development, enterprise operation needs scientific management. Enterprises affected by the coordinated development of economy and environment pay great attention to environmental protection, and improve the measures of resource and environmental protection, so as to complete the task of overall development of enterprises. This paper discusses the internal financial management problems of small and medium-sized enterprises in low-carbon development, effectively improves the internal financial control based on big data technology, and puts forward the development path to promote the healthy and stable progress of small and medium-sized enterprises.",

However, these computers are increasingly heterogeneous and are based on a ccNUMA architecture. In such architectures, main memory access times differ depending on the core on which access is requested. Hence, as well as locality of data access throughout a cluster of servers, locality of memory access within individual servers can have an impact on performance.Java is a commonly-used language for Big Data applications (through the popularity of Hadoop) and the newly-released Java 8 introduces streams to simplify data-parallel programming. However, this paper argues that there are no built-in parallel stream sources that can efficiently operate on very large datasets and take data locality into account. This paper details recent work from the JUNIPER project, an EU Framework 7 Project, which is investigating how the Java 8 platform (augmented by the Real-Time Specification for Java) can be used for real-time Big Data applications. JUNIPER introduces architecture-aware stream sources which are suitable for Big Data systems and which preserve locality of data. Our results show that when reading data from disk, thread affinity can seriously degrade the performance of standard Java streams, but JUNIPER's architecture-aware streams maintain their performance.",

The e-commerce of the agricultural product has been quickly developed with the internet, particularly the big data emerging. However, some problems appear while the fast growth of the agricultural e-commerce is flourishing the economy and improving the people's life. They are restricting the further growth of the agricultural e-commerce. How to deal with these problems is worthwhile to be considered. So, the paper first exposes the real state of the agricultural e-commerce in the conditions of the big data, then finds out some key problems constraining the further growth of the e-commerce of the agricultural item under the big data by comparing the existent suppliers and e-commerce platforms in the agricultural e-commerce industrial chain, finally proposes some countermeasures to solve the problems.",

While there has been research in these areas for already over one decade, still many open challenges exist because of technology triggers like lightweight virtualization, increasing capabilities of nodes and increasing massive parallelization.

These algorithms seek to provide accurate results while minimizing the required storage and the processing time, at the price of a small inaccuracy in their output. A fundamental query of interest is the intersection size of two big data streams. This problem arises in many different application areas, such as network monitoring, database systems, data integration and information retrieval. In this paper we develop a new algorithm for this problem, based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. We show that this algorithm outperforms all known schemes in terms of the estimation's quality (lower variance) and that it asymptotically achieves the optimal variance.",

However, the more complex SOA develops, the more likely are data quality (DQ) issues to be encountered. Despite the huge number of studies that have been done on SOA, very little has been investigated about the DQ aspect. In this paper we address issues concerning the detection of data quality problems. Hence, we propose a DQ methodology in the SOA context which will assess semantic (business) data.",

Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of Big Data application and data science leads toward a new paradigm of human behavior, where various smart devices integrate with each other and establish a relationship. However, majority of the systems are either memoryless or computational inefficient, which are unable to define or predict human behavior. Therefore, keeping in view the aforementioned needs, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that integrates social network with the technical network. We derive a novel notion of 'Smart Socio Network', where a friendship is made based on the geo-location information of the user, and trust index is used based on graphs theory. The proposed graph theory provides a better understanding of extraction knowledge from the data and finding relationship between different users.",

Experimental results show that the analytical hierarchy process improves the efficiency of energy saving(EA) monitoring and management analysis by air conditioning with 43%, and reduces the wrong alarm rate and the wrong alarm rate. Finally, by comparing the analysis of the air-conditioning energy-saving monitoring management system and the analysis of the instantaneous energy consumption and the cumulative energy consumption of the system classification, the influence of big data technology on the air-conditioning energy-saving monitoring management analysis is explained.",

In order to obtain the intrinsic relationship and implicit information from these large-scale data, data mining as an important method has been paid more and more attention by people, and cluster analysis is an important research direction of data mining. In the era of big data, massive multi-modal data exists widely. How to mine the huge hidden value of data through complementary learning between modal data is the main problem of big data research at this stage, and it is also the task of big data and traditional data learning. Mixed attribute datasets are the most common type of datasets in the real world, especially in commercial financial databases, but there are very few clustering algorithms suitable for such datasets. The method used in this paper is machine learning, which enables computers to simulate human learning behavior, automatically acquire knowledge and skills through learning, continuously improve performance, and achieve self-improvement.",

However, the design and integration of such components is complex, especially for Big Data applications where they have very large workloads to elaborate. Properly customizing the accelerators' private local memories (PLMs) is of critical importance. To analyze this problem we design an accelerator for Collaborative Filtering by applying a system-level design methodology that allows us to synthesize many alternative micro-architectures as we vary the PLM sizes. We then evaluate the resulting accelerators in terms of resource requirements for both embedded architectures and data centers as we vary the size and density of the workloads.",

These scientific news articles create illusions and misconceptions, thus ultimately influence the public opinion, with serious consequences at a broader social scale. Yet, existing solutions aiming at automatically verifying the credibility of news articles are still unsatisfactory. We propose to verify scientific news by retrieving and analyzing its most relevant source papers from an academic digital library (DL), e.g., arXiv. Instead of querying keywords or regular named entities extracted from news articles, we query domain knowledge entities (DKEs) extracted from the text. By querying each DKE, we retrieve a list of candidate scholarly papers. We then design a function to rank them and select the most relevant scholarly paper. After exploring various representations, experiments indicate that the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representation with cosine similarity outperforms baseline models based on word embedding. This result demonstrates the efficacy of using DKEs to retrieve scientific papers which are relevant to a specific news article. It also indicates that word embedding may not be the best document representation for domain specific document retrieval tasks. Our method is fully automated and can be effectively applied to facilitating fake and misinformed news detection across many scientific domains.",

In order to explore the impact of applying BDT technology to educational economy and management on the construction of the content system of this major, this paper specially selects two universities a and B as the experimental research objects. University a applies BDT technology in the construction of educational economy and management, while university B still constructs the teaching content according to the conventional method Building. Then our experimental results show that the teaching performance and class efficiency of university a are much higher than that of University B. The highest teaching performance and class efficiency of university a are 97% and 97% respectively, and the highest teaching performance and class efficiency of University B are 82% and 85% respectively.",

Recently, Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) driven approaches are shown as having good predictive accuracy. 'Big Data' as input enhances the inferential power of algorithms, but it challenges even state-of-the-art computation methods. The runtime complexity of SVDD is linear in the number of support vectors. Hence speeding up the decision function becomes important for applications requiring fast real time performance. This work aims to provide solutions that reduce the computational complexity of SVDD so as to make one-class classification practical on Big Data. The proposed work first reduces the complexity of SVDD by computing a point known as the agent of the SVDD sphere center in the input space during the training phase. It retains the benefit of the kernel trick also. We then propose to hadoopize this lightly trained SVDD named as LT-SVDD so that a faster classification can be achieved in a big-data setting.",

Such projects have increasing demands on throughput (e.g., 100Gbps line rates), and require a high amount of configurability. Collecting and sharing traffic data for such networks can help in detecting hotspots, troubleshooting, and designing novel routing protocols. However, sharing network data directly introduces serious privacy breaches, as an adversary may be able to derive private details about individual users (e.g., personal preferences or activity patterns). Our objective is to sanitize high-speed research network data according to the de-facto standard of differential privacy (DP), thus supporting benefic applications of traffic measurement without compromising individuals' privacy. In this paper, we present an initial framework for computing DP-compliant big data analytics for high-speed research network data. Specifically, we focus on sharing data at flow-level granularity, and we describe our initial steps towards an environment that relies on Hadoop and HBase to support privacy-preserving NetFlow analytics.",

Many of these decisions involve moral judgments that are then transformed into specific actions. Side effects of the choices made by the decision systems can be dangerous, so we have to be very careful when increasing the capacity of these systems. The decisions the autonomous systems make should be as ethical as possible. This paper adapts the observe-orient-decide-act (OODA) loop to the decision-making process in the moral area. It combines the parameterization of cognitive aspects of autonomous systems with ethical standards and moral inference. Problems related to the implementation of moral inference to autonomous systems, including artificial intelligence (AI) systems, are presented. Thanks to the adaptation of the OODA loop, it is possible to make morally correct decisions and actions based on a set of ethical principles adjusted to a specific situation. The presented proposal allows for moral inference, which extends the possibilities of autonomous systems that use the inference loop, especially those processing Big Data. The decision-making system still has the possibility of a choice aimed at doing more good or less evil.",

As a result, data-movement energy dominates overall energy consumption and this will get worse with a technology scaling. We propose scale-in clusters with In-Storage Processing (ISP) devices that would enable energy efficient computing for big-data analytics. ISP devices eliminate/reduce data movements towards CPUs and execute tasks more energy-efficiently. Thus, with energy efficient computing near data and higher throughput enabled, clusters with ISP can achieve more than quadruple energy efficiency with fewer number of nodes as compared to the energy efficiency of similarly performing its counter-part scale-out clusters.",

Our university is a medium-sized, public, Hispanic-serving institution; our department is small. Our goals were to improve the social support available to our Hispanic students, encourage them to complete their degrees, and give them a valid research experience to provide a basis for informed decisions about whether or not they want to go to graduate school. This paper will cover how we structured our program to accomplish our goals, including how we factored in results from prior research on minority student experiences. In the second year, we expanded our program to include geography and give a new cohort of students a multi-disciplinary experience. We will discuss how a small computer science department successfully built an undergraduate research program organized around the theme of large data sets, what we have accomplished so far and how we hope to continue.",

                "abstract": "The Berkeley AMPLab was founded on the idea that the challenges of emerging Big Data applications require a new approach to analytics systems. Launching in early 2011, the project set out to rethink the traditional analytics stack, breaking down technical and intellectual barriers that had arisen during decades of evolutionary development. The vision of the lab is to seamlessly integrate the three main resources available for making sense of data at scale: Algorithms (such as machine learning and statistical techniques), Machines (in the form of scalable clusters and elastic cloud computing), and People (both individually as analysts and en masse, as with crowd-sourced human computation). To pursue this goal, we assembled a research team with diverse interests across computer science, forged relationships with domain experts on campus and elsewhere, and obtained the support of leading industry partners and major government sponsors. The lab is realizing its ideas through the development of a freely-available Open Source software stack called BDAS: the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack. In the nearly three years the lab has been in operation, we've released major components of BDAS. Several of these components have gained significant traction in industry and elsewhere: the Mesos cluster resource manager, the Spark in-memory computation framework, and the Shark query processing system. In this talk I'll describe the current state of BDAS with an emphasis on the key components that have been released to date. I'll then discuss ongoing efforts on machine learning scalability and ease of use, including the MLbase system, as our focus moves higher up the stack. Finally I will present our longer-term views of how all the pieces will fit together to form a system that can adaptively bring the right resources to bear on a given data-driven question to meet time, cost and quality requirements throughout the analytics lifecycle.",

Traditional encrypted storage technology and management methods have been difficult to meet the requirements of big data in terms of speed, capacity, storage efficiency and security. Under the data environment, users' data security and privacy protection are facing great challenges. A vector evaluation genetic algorithm is proposed. The algorithm uses population diversity information to adjust inertia weight nonlinearly, and introduces velocity mutation operator and position crossover operator in the later stage of the algorithm, so that the algorithm can get rid of the constraint that it is easy to fall into local optimum in the later stage, so as to solve the multi-objective reactive power optimization problem and solve the Pareto optimal solution set of the problem. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the privacy protection performance of users' information, and the encryption and hiding overhead of the algorithm is small, and the real-time performance of information coding and hiding is high.",

The identifying feature of SGD is that, much like in gradient descent for deterministic optimization, each successive iterate in the recursion is determined by adding an appropriately scaled gradient estimate to the prior iterate. Owing to several factors, SGD has become the leading method to solve optimization problems arising within large-scale machine learning and \"big data\" contexts such as classification and regression. This tutorial covers the basics of SGD with an emphasis on modern developments. The tutorial starts with examples where SGD is applicable, and then details important flavors of SGD and reported complexity calculations.",

Under the background of big data, the Internet ideology education in colleges and universities has faced many difficulties and opportunities. Educators must correctly understand the positive significance of ideology education, effectively combine the characteristics of network development, and better carry out ideology education.

These tables, however, are heterogeneous in structure, concepts, and metadata. One of the challenges in semantically extracting geographic data is the need to resolve these heterogeneities so as to uncover a conceptual hierarchy, metadata associated with instances, and geographic information---corresponding respectively to ontologies, elements that we call features, and cell values that can be used to identify geographic coordinates. In this paper, we present an architecture with methods to: (1) extract feature-rich web tables; (2) identify features; (3) construct a schema and instances using RDF; (4) perform geocoding. Preliminary experiments led to high accuracy in table identification and feature naming even when compared to manual evaluation.",

                "abstract": "Data mining can hardly solve but always faces a problem that there is little meaningful information within the dataset serving a given requirement. Faced with multiple unknown datasets, to allocate data mining resources to acquire more desired data, it is necessary to establish a data quality assessment framework based on the relevance between the dataset and requirements. This framework can help the user to judge the potential benefits in advance, so as to optimize the resource allocation to those candidates. However, the unstructured data (e.g., image data) often presents dark data states, which makes it tricky for the user to understand the relevance based on content of the dataset in real time. Even if all data have label descriptions, how to measure the relevance between data efficiently under semantic propagation remains an urgent problem. Based on this, we propose a Deep Hash-based Relevance-aware Data Quality Assessment framework, which contains off-line learning and relevance mining parts as well as an on-line assessing part. In the off-line part, we first design a Graph Convolution Network (GCN)-AutoEncoder hash (GAH) algorithm to recognize the data (i.e., lighten the dark data), then construct a graph with restricted Hamming distance, and finally design a Cluster PageRank (CPR) algorithm to calculate the importance score for each node (image) so as to obtain the relevance representation based on semantic propagation. In the on-line part, we first retrieve the importance score by hash codes and then quickly get the assessment conclusion in the importance list. On the one hand, the introduction of GCN and co-occurrence probability in the GAH promotes the perception ability for dark data. On the other hand, the design of CPR utilizes hash collision to reduce the scale of graph and iteration matrix, which greatly decreases the consumption of space and computing resources. We conduct extensive experiments on both single-label and multi-label datasets to assess the relevance between data and requirements as well as test the resources allocation. Experimental results show our framework can gain the most desired data with the same mining resources. Besides, the test results on Tencent1M dataset demonstrate the framework can complete the assessment with a stability for given different requirements.",

This paper contains a framework using keywords in social media search engines that aims to gain users' habits by utilizing social media data. The framework offered is in the form of steps to optimize the search engines, so that the optimal social media search engine could be used as an entry point to find the desired data on specific social media user. The step is initialized by analyzing existing posts to get more specific and accurate data from social media users. The social media system then could use those specific keywords to identify the identity of a specific user in the information space that can be accessed by the search engines.",

Integrate and classify English teaching data, formulate appropriate courses for the allocation of teaching resources, and evaluate English teaching ability; after using the comparative analysis method, the following conclusions are reached: the period of formation of English teaching ability is after employment, especially the use of teaching methods, educational wit, and teaching and research abilities are all higher than 80%. In addition, the two abilities of teaching organization and management and teaching content processing are also more than 75% after the job.",

However, the state-of-the-art iSAX-based indexing techniques do not scale well due to the binary fanout that leads to a highly deep index tree and suffer from accuracy degradation due to the character-level cardinality that leads to poor maintenance of the proximity. To address this problem, we recently proposed TARDIS to supports indexing and querying billion-scale data series datasets. It introduces a new iSAX-T signatures to reduce the cardinality conversion cost and corresponding sigTree to construct a compact index structure to preserve better similarity. The framework consists of one centralized index and local distributed indices to efficiently re-partition and index dimensional datasets. Besides, effective query strategies based on sigTree structure are proposed to greatly improve the accuracy. In this demonstration, we present GENET, a new interactive exploration demonstration that allows users to support Big Data Series Approximate Retrieval and Recursive Interactive Clustering in large-scale geospatial datasets using TARDIS index techniques.",

It is because scheduling has responsibility to allocate resources for running applications based on resource capacity, queues, running tasks, and the number of users. Changing single node to multi node Hadoop cluster can optimize HDFS, but quite costly. Scheduler performs the function of scheduling based on resource requirements, such as memory, CPU, disk, and network. The most general purpose of scheduling algorithm is minimizing the time of completing a task. Hadoop Scheduling is an independent module where users are able to design their own scheduler based on the application's actual need. So it can fulfill the specific need of the business in accordance with the desired result. This research will analyze the characteristic of Capacity Scheduler and Fair Scheduler.",

Today, processing context data is increasingly done by proprietary algorithms tuned to a specific use-case, e.g., a sensor measuring activity intensity of a cow. Readings from these sensors may be subject to data distribution shifts, which challenge robustness of models using these sensor readings. In this paper, we propose a new sensor data processing framework, which leverages a co-dependency between data quality and model robustness to detect performance issues of data-driven predictive models in the field. We show how distribution shifts in the input data impact the quality of the model, which relies on application-specific sensors, and present indicators capable of detecting such shifts in the wild. The proposed framework used in the context of precision cattle farming allows improving the quality of cow lameness predictive models on the field data by up to 62%.",

Modern DISC applications pose new challenges in exhaustive, automatic testing because they consist of dataflow operators, and complex user-defined functions (UDF) are prevalent unlike SQL queries. We design a new white-box testing approach, called BigTest to reason about the internal semantics of UDFs in tandem with the equivalence classes created by each dataflow and relational operator. Our evaluation shows that, despite ultra-large scale input data size, real world DISC applications are often significantly skewed and inadequate in terms of test coverage, leaving 34% of Joint Dataflow and UDF (JDU) paths untested. BigTest shows the potential to minimize data size for local testing by 10^5 to 10^8 orders of magnitude while revealing 2X more manually-injected faults than the previous approach. Our experiment shows that only few of the data records (order of tens) are actually required to achieve the same JDU coverage as the entire production data. The reduction in test data also provides CPU time saving of 194X on average, demonstrating that interactive and fast local testing is feasible for big data analytics, obviating the need to test applications on huge production data.",

But crowdsourcing impacts data quality both due to device and OS heterogeneity, and to annotation errors. Additionally, it is often necessary to deal with multimodality, i.e. participants using different travel modes often in the same trip. In this paper, we address how to draw value from a crowdsensed dataset for characterising mobility demand through origin-destination (OD) matrices, highlighting challenges and providing some solutions.First, we identify typical errors in heterogeneous location data, propose and compare methods to automatically improve data quality. Then, we devise a method to detect among 5 transport modes (walk, car, bus, metro, bike) offline a posteriori. We segment trips on stopped periods and propose a random forest model to detect transportation mode per segment using only location data. Our results show that with adequate pre-processing and robust features, an RF classifier is able to achieve accuracy and precision of 85% in trip segments. This is similar to the literature, but our work uses a very heterogeneous crowdsourced trajectory dataset when compared to the others. Finally, we quantify the impact of the model on mulit-modal OD matrices and whole trip characterisation. We can correctly identify used transportation modes accurately, but the precision is impaired by the high likelihood of at least one false positive in the whole trip.",

                "abstract": "The aim of this workshop is to bring together people from both academia and industry to present their most recent work related to big-data issues, and exchange ideas and thoughts in order to advance this big-data challenge, which has been considered as one of the most exciting opportunities in the past 10 years.Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our ability to collect data from various sensors, devices, in different formats, from independent or connected applications. This data flood has outpaced our capability to process, analyze, store and understand these datasets. Consider the Internet data. The web pages indexed by Google were around one million in 1998, but quickly reached 1 billion in 2000 and have already exceeded 1 trillion in 2008. This rapid expansion is accelerated by the dramatic increase in acceptance of social networking applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc., that allow users to create contents freely and amplify the already huge Web volume. Furthermore, with mobile phones becoming the sensory gateway to get real-time data on people from different aspects, the vast amount of data that mobile carrier can potentially process to improve our daily life has significantly outpaced our past CDR (call data record)- based processing for billing purposes only. It can be foreseen that Internet of things (IoT) applications will raise the scale of data to an unprecedented level. People and devices (from home coffee machines to cars, to buses, railway stations and airports) are all loosely connected. Trillions of such connected components will generate a huge data ocean, and valuable information must be discovered from the data to help improve quality of life and make our world a better place. For example, after we get up every morning, in order to optimize our commute time to work and complete the optimization before we arrive at office, the system needs to process information from traffic, weather, construction, police activities to our calendar schedules, and perform deep optimization under the tight time constraints. In all these applications, we are facing significant challenges in leveraging the vast amount of data, including challenges in (1) system capabilities (2) algorithmic design (3) business models.",

The cybersecurity community typically reacts to attacks after they occur. Being reactive is costly and can be fatal, where attacks threaten lives, important data, or mission success. Taking a proactive approach, we are: (I) identifying potential attacks before they come to fruition, and based on this identification; (II) developing preventive counter-measures. We describe a Proactive Cybersecurity System (PCS), a layered, modular service platform that applies big data collection and processing tools a wide variety of unstructured data sources to identify potential attacks and develop countermeasures. The PCS provides security analysts a holistic, proactive, and systematic approach to cybersecurity. Here we describe our research vision and progress towards that vision.",

It fully reflects the development direction and measures of the current social education system. The purpose of this study is to study the financial management (FM) mode and strengthen the current FM work in colleges and universities (CAU), so that CAU can get considerable development in FM, and build an efficient FM mode to ensure the financial stability of HVC, and to ensure adequate education funds. Based on the reform of china's higher education system, through the use of big data technology for reference, this paper analyzes the shortcomings of the asset management mode of a higher vocational college in Jiangxi province, and finds corresponding solutions. The results show that the expenditure of teachers and teaching assistants accounts for 26.3% of the total education cost. However, books and grants accounted for 22.4% and 4.8% respectively. Housing construction accounts for the largest proportion of fixed assets in HVC, with an increase rate of 33.8% from 53.4 million yuan in 2016 to 71.45 million yuan in 2019.",

Intelligent power distribution and utilization (IPDU) big data platform, which exchanges operation data with other related distribution network management systems, makes decisions for demand side management, power system and distributed energy operation strategies by analyzing the big data. In order to solve the data fusion and exchange problems among all information systems, we proposed a kind of general information model for multi-source heterogeneous big data. In addition, a data fusion and exchange mechanism is established based on circle buffer to ensure the data quality. Finally, this paper demonstrates the effective of the method of IPDU big data fusion method by the example of distribution network reconfiguration. The method proposed in this paper can satisfy the data exchanging demands of future smart grid and demand side management, and it also has good confluent and extensible feature.",

The convenience and rapidity of the Internet make finance continuously integrate into people's daily life. Internet finance, as one of the innovative forms of financial information, has developed rapidly in just a few years under the support of information technology. While seeing that Internet finance has brought great support to economic development, we can't ignore its various problems. The potential risks accumulated in the early stage of the Internet finance industry are constantly erupting, exposing various problems in financial supervision, which not only damages the rights and interests of the long-tail group, but also increases the social cost, which is not conducive to the long-term development of the Internet finance industry. This paper discusses the inheritance and innovation relationship between big data analysis and traditional financial statistics. Based on the decision tree classification algorithm, aiming at strengthening financial supervision and improving macro decision-making level, this paper puts forward the idea of making overall use of big data analysis and statistical analysis.",

The development of big data has intensified economic globalization, the business scale of the group company continuously expands to all regions and the trend of extending from China to abroad is more obvious, increasing the difficulty in financial control of each branch (subsidiary) by the group. To solve the problem, the group enterprises are required to accelerate the promotion of financial transformation and upgrading, focus on enhancing financial value creation and business support capabilities and effectively control financial and operational risks. The research and practice show that the effect achieved by implementing financial sharing service is relatively remarkable. This paper takes Haier enterprise as a case for study and analysis, studies the problems in the application of enterprise Financial Shared Service Center under the big data environment, deeply analyzes the cause of the problem, and puts forward detailed solutions and suggestions for specific problems. With Haier's Financial Shared Service Center as the study object, this paper studies the advantage and application of financial sharing, the specific operation of each business process, the deficiencies of each financial management module and the process modules of the Financial Shared Service Center to be improved and optimized under the big data technology environment, and explores the theoretical methods and practical application value of enterprises optimizing the Financial Shared Center under the background of big data by deep analysis of Haier case.",

Performance and scalability issues of traditional database management systems (DBMS) often limit the usage of more sophisticated and complex data queries and analytic models. Moreover, in the conventional setting, data management and analysis use separate software platforms. Exporting and importing large amounts of data across platforms require a significant amount of computational and I/O resources, as well as potentially putting sensitive data at a security risk. In this tutorial, the participants will learn the difference between in-memory DBMS and traditional DBMS through hands-on exercises using SAP's cloud-based HANA in-memory DBMS in conjunction with the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset. MIMIC is an open-access critical care EHR archive (over 4TB in size) and consists of structured, unstructured and waveform data. Furthermore, this tutorial will seek to educate the participants on how a combination of dynamic querying, and in-memory DBMS may enhance the management and analysis of complex clinical data.",

It specifies why this coding language is important and how it simplifies the data analysis process through the use of open-source Python libraries. The advantages of Python compared to the other similar languages such as C, and MATLAB are also included. Lastly, this project will also review several Python packages that can be downloaded from open-source online resources. There are explanations of the ways the Python packages can assist a Python programmer, novice or expert, analyze data functions in numerous different professional fields. Specifically, this paper will go over the Matplotlib package and one specific dataset example that can be used with it. Matplotlib example is included to show what functions a programmer can access when using Python based libraries. It showcases the ease of use of Python when visualizing data in a dataset.",

The current problems faced in the development of physical education classroom management have emerged as new solution ideas in the context of BD, and the application of BD thinking to solve classroom management problems is a proven means. The purpose of this paper is to study the management of physical education classroom teaching in the context of BD. From the perspective of education policy and education management, this paper explores the problems that arise in China's physical education classroom and the corresponding solutions based on three aspects: cognition, mechanism and management mode in the context of BD. This paper adopts various analytical methods such as SWOT analysis, field interview method and questionnaire survey method to explore the problems in the development of physical education classroom teaching management, and proposes the use of BD technology to promote the construction of physical education informatization, so as to improve the teaching mode and learning mode of physical education classroom and enhance the quality of physical education teaching. The experimental results show that only 35% of physical education teachers feel that school sports facilities and necessary sports equipment can be fully satisfied in teaching in the era of BD, but more than 70% of students like physical education classes, so school administrators and physical education teachers need to improve the importance of physical education classes.",

In the context of the rapid development of big data technology, how to organically combine multi-source data, improve model accuracy, improve work efficiency and reduce work cost is a key issue in the construction of traffic generation analysis model. This paper integrates relevant data such as resident travel OD data, population migration data, and poi data. On the basis of the traditional traffic generation model, add the geographical advantage correction factor to establish a city area traffic generation analysis model based on multi-source big data. And take Heyuan City, Guangdong Province as an example for case analysis to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the model. The results show that the average absolute errors of traffic production and attraction in all traffic communities are 16.29% and 14.98% respectively. This paper can provide a new method to improve the accuracy of city area traffic generation analysis modeling.CCS CONCEPTS • Applied computing • Operations research • Transportation",

User phone have been widely recognized as user identities and are registered in a large number of Internet applications. Due to the leakage of user information, a series of social problems have arisen. Abnormal telephone has become a social problem to be solved. Current methods are mostly passive detection methods, and some of them are extremely expensive and do not meet the requirements of practical application. Our current situation of lack of effective control measures and active detection methods for abnormal phones. Based on the existing telecommunication big data, an abnormal phone active detection method is designed based on learning to rank and ensemble learning algorithm. The experimental results on the real dataset show that the proposed method has higher accuracy than the experimental results obtained by a single learning algorithm.",

One of the main advantages of model-driven approaches is the provision of a conceptual structure where the models used by business managers and analysts can be traced towards more detailed models used by software developers. This kind of alignment between high level business specifications and the lower level Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) is a crucial aspect in the field of Service-Oriented Development (SOD) where meaningful business services and business process specifications are those that can give support to real business environment usually changing with increasing speed. SOD has become currently in one of the major research topics in the field of software engineering, leading the appearance of a novel and emerging discipline called Service Engineering (SE), which aim to bring together benefits of SOA and Business Process Management (BPM). SE focuses on the identification of service (a client-provider interaction that creates value for the client) as first class elements for the software construction. The convergence of SE with MDE holds out the promise of rapid and accurate development of software that serves software users' goals.On the other hand, Information technologies are becoming one of the most important aspects for organizations. The business value of the data stored in the company databases has been growing to become one of the most important assets of the company. These data represent one crucial asset for tactic, strategic and operational decisions. Due to this important role of the data, companies should assure the access to the data to several users guaranteeing the right levels of quality they need to accomplish the task they have to do.Data Quality is a crucial issue in assessing the quality of business decisions support systems. Many aspects are related with the quality of the data, such as integrity, completeness, actuality and several other factors that make this kind of quality a multidimensional issue and a difficult issue. Data Security is another crucial aspect on information systems, not only because it affects Data Quality, but also because current information systems store sensitive and private data that should be treated rightly. Also, as Data Quality and Data Security are not independent concepts, the relationship between both concepts is worth being analyzed in order to give organizations some tools that can help in assuring both data dimensions.The Workshop on Model Driven Service Engineering and Data Quality and Security intends to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners working on different issues related to SE in conjunction with MDE, boarding open research problems in this area as well as practical experiences. The workshop is also focused on auditing, measuring, predicting, evaluating, controlling, assuring and improving the quality and security of data. Particular interests include methods, modelling languages, development methodologies and techniques in these fields.The six full papers (an acceptance rate of 54.5%) and four short papers were selected very carefully by the Program Committee in order to ensure a high quality workshop.",

Over the last two years, our team has developed a distributed crawling infrastructure called ZeroCrawler that automatically crawls and updates ZeroNet websites in realtime. It stores data into a research repository designed to help better understand ZeroNet's hidden service ecosystem. The analysis component of our framework is called Automated Multi-Categorization Labeling (AMCL), which introduces a three-stage thematic labeling strategy: (1) it learns descriptive and discriminative keywords for different categories, and (2) get a probability distribution of the keywords for different categories, and then (3) uses these terms to map ZeroNet website content to several labels. We also present empirical results of AMCL and our ongoing experimentation with it, as we have gained experience applying it to the entirety of our ZeroNet repository, now over 3000 indexed websites. The experimental results show that AMCL can discover categories on previously unlabeled websites, and we discuss applications of AMCL in supporting various analyses and investigations of the ZeroNet websites.",

However, the scale of Web big data is so huge that users cannot directly obtain the information they need from it. Data migration is a key part of data system integration to ensure smooth system upgrades and updates, and it also plays an important role in cloud computing. The quality of data migration is not only an important prerequisite for the new system to be put into use, but also a strong guarantee for stable operation in the future. When cloud computing lays out data sets, because it mainly considers the load in the data, it will generally give priority to distributing the data sets in the data with lower load. Such a layout method makes it possible to perform tasks of these two types of applications. When the number of network visits increases, problems such as increasing the number of network visits will be prevented. For these two special applications, this paper designs an efficient and dynamic data migration algorithm based on the association rule mining model to optimize the migration performance.",

Thus, massive movement processes are underway in the world every day and it is critical to ensure their safe, timely and efficient operation. Towards this end, low-cost sensing and acquisition of the movement data is being achieved: from GPS devices, RFID and barcode scanners, to smart commuter cards and smartphones, snapshots of the movement process are becoming available.In this talk, I will present a system for stitching together these snapshots and reconstructing urban mobility at a very fine-grained level. The system, which we call the Space-Time Engine, provides an interactive dashboard and a querying engine for answering questions such as: what is the crowding at a train station? where're packages held up and how can their delivery be sped up? how can the available supply of transport capacity be better used to address daily demand as well as the demand on exceptional days (such as rallies and severe weather events). I will describe the STE's capabilities for operational and planning purposes, and as a learning system.",

However, big data alsobrings unique opportunities in its wake by enabling new modeling and analytics approaches as well as facilitating novel applications. We highlight a few key challenges andopportunities, and outline research directions for addressing them. To provide a proper context, we also summarize CPS modeling approaches, and discuss how modeling and analytics for CPS differs from general purpose IT systems.",

                "abstract": "Big data processing at the production scale presents a highly complex environment for resource optimization (RO), a problem crucial for meeting performance goals and budgetary constraints of analytical users. The RO problem is challenging because it involves a set of decisions (the partition count, placement of parallel instances on machines, and resource allocation to each instance), requires multi-objective optimization (MOO), and is compounded by the scale and complexity of big data systems while having to meet stringent time constraints for scheduling. This paper presents a MaxCompute based integrated system to support multi-objective resource optimization via fine-grained instance-level modeling and optimization. We propose a new architecture that breaks RO into a series of simpler problems, new fine-grained predictive models, and novel optimization methods that exploit these models to make effective instance-level RO decisions well under a second. Evaluation using production workloads shows that our new RO system could reduce 37--72% latency and 43--78% cost at the same time, compared to the current optimizer and scheduler, while running in 0.02-0.23s.",

The purpose of this article is to analyze the status quo of CE learning based on big data technology. This article first analyzes the impact of Big Data technology on CE learning, discusses the challenges faced by Big Data technology on CE learning, and reflects on the application of Big Data in the process of CE learning. This article takes English majors of school A as the research object, uses questionnaires to explore the English learning of Big Data in English learning, and analyzes the status quo of CE learning, so as to provide a certain level for teachers and students of related majors to improve learning efficiency and learning interest in the teaching and learning process. The survey data shows that when college students are learning English, 24.1% of English learners want to improve their listening ability; 33.3% of learners want to practice oral English on learning devices, indicating that CE learning pays more attention to the cultivation and improvement of listening and speaking ability.",

                "abstract": "In the background of today's big data era, the popularization of computer network and information technology helps us to understand and disseminate the hot information in the current society more quickly. By quickly understanding these hot issues, we can better supervise and prevent these problems in our life. In recent years, the problem of food safety appears frequently in our field of vision, which makes people have to regard food safety as a hot issue in today's social development. The state and relevant food safety supervision departments are also paying attention to the food safety problems. In order to better supervise food safety issues in this era of big data, this paper will analyze and study food safety issues with the help of popular technologies in the new era, such as artificial intelligence technology and big data technology, so as to formulate a new scheme to meet the needs of people in the new era for food safety supervision. Through the research, it can be found that a series of methods proposed in this paper can effectively provide new ideas for food safety big data visual analysis research method based on artificial intelligence.",
