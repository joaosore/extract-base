Traditional SCF is difficult to realize practical business market because of lack of physical things self-tracked capability intelligently. The proposed IoT-based risk management performance big data analysis is capable of predicting different risk states by tracking transaction status changes to control risk management in SCF. The proposed approach is proved success solution for SCF according to the performance index evaluation. Moreover, heuristic fuzzy QFD algorithms are provided to explore the risk management performance big data analysis.

Today, big data has relevant applications in the industry due to improvements in the system performance and by turning information into knowledge. Big data challenges include the lack of strategies to process computational cost and the large amount of data when computing machine learning predictions. To overcome these scalability issues, it is convenient to work with distributed and parallelized architecture across multiple nodes. The approach is based on Apache Spark, an in-memory distributed application that offers extensive machine learning libraries. The main contribution of the study is to measure the scalability by calculating the execution time that a classifier achieves with larger workloads. We validate our classifier models with experiments on logistic regression and random forest by studying their adaptability to the Apache Spark framework. The present work expects to combine the areas of big data and machine learning on scalability, and the use of optimization methods, cache and persist. In addition, a comparison between the classifiers is provided. The evaluation experiments show that logistic regression performed the shortest execution time and best scalability.",

Most of these data have the participation of our individual users, and the left data footprints can be gathered together to discover a lot of personal privacy. Big data can bring better work and life experience to users, however, it also brings the risk of personal privacy disclosure. This paper will use some theories of sociology, including anomie theory, social control theory, cultural conflict theory, and social exchange theory, to understand the knowledge of big data privacy, and point out some technologies that could solve out the problem: anonymity technology, data encryption technology, different privacy.",

While Spark integrates with the older Hadoop ecosystem, it provides much more intuitive, faster, and powerful abstractions for manipulating distributed data than MapReduce. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of the Spark library with the goal of getting participants up to speed so that they can use the library or teach it in courses that involve big data or distributed processing. Participants will work with examples that range from calculating basic summary statistics to using the Spark Machine Learning library for performing sophisticated machine learning analyses on large datasets. Tasks during the session will be performed on smaller samples using the Spark local standalone implementation on participant's laptops. We will also discuss how Spark can be run on a local or cloud-based cluster and point participants toward resources for setting up those environments for their students.",

When the machine learning model is trained by using imbalanced big data, the problem with performance drops for the minority class occurs. For this reason, various oversampling methodologies have been proposed, but simple oversampling leads to problem of the overfitting. In this paper, we propose a meta learning methodology for efficient analysis of imbalanced big data. The proposed meta learning methodology uses the meta information of the data generated by the generative model based on Generative Adversarial Networks. It prevents the generative model from becoming too similar to the real data in minority class. Compared to the simple oversampling methodology for analyzing imbalanced big data, it is less likely to cause overfitting. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently analyze imbalanced big data.",

Generally, big data is first analyzed and then used with other available data in the company to make it more effective. Therefore, big data is never operated in isolation. There are a variety of non-relational data stores (databases) available. These data stores and big data can be used in combination to work with. Attributes of these databases are available for companies where big data is used. In last few years it is the requirement of companies that these databases should operate very fast, it should be extended/contracted whenever required and should generate reports quickly. It also requires that the different means should be available to manage and organize these massive databases. This paper mainly focuses on some methods for data management like key-value databases, document databases, tabular databases, object data bases and graph databases. Use of RDBMS for big data implementation is not practical because of its performance, scale or even cost. Now a day's companies have adopted non-relational databases, known as NoSQL databases. Programmers and analysts may take benefit of non-relational databases as it has simple modeling constraints than the relational databases. Analysts can do various types of analysis by taking different types of non-relational databases every time. For example, key value databases, graph databases. The non-relational databases do not depend on the common traditional relational database management systems.",

To innovate, the first thing is to enhance one's own scientific and technological capabilities, and increased R&D investment is the key to innovative development of such enterprises. The government has become the leading force in the national innovation system. The government's R&D investment, as an important means and method for the government to lead the national innovation system, is attracting more and more attention. Meanwhile, as the key leader grasping enterprise direction, executives play a decisive role in the development decision of enterprises. The executives of big data and artificial intelligence listed companies in China must realize that the core of development is independent innovation. It is especially of practical significance and research value to study the relationship between executive incentives of big data and artificial intelligence listed companies, government technology subsidies and innovation performance, and propose corresponding suggestions for the future development direction of new economy.",

It discusses the system challenges presented by the Big Data problems associated with network intrusion prediction. The prediction of a possible intrusion attack in a network requires continuous collection of traffic data and learning of their characteristics on the fly. The continuous collection of traffic data by the network leads to Big Data problems that are caused by the volume, variety and velocity properties of Big Data. The learning of the network characteristics require machine learning techniques that capture global knowledge of the traffic patterns. The Big Data properties will lead to significant system challenges to implement machine learning frameworks. This paper discusses the problems and challenges in handling Big Data classification using geometric representation-learning techniques and the modern Big Data networking technologies. In particular this paper discusses the issues related to combining supervised learning techniques, representation-learning techniques, machine lifelong learning techniques and Big Data technologies (e.g. Hadoop, Hive and Cloud) for solving network traffic classification problems.",

Thus, the traditional enterprise security perimeter is disappearing and evolving into the concept of security intelligence where the volume, velocity/rate, and variety of data have dramatically changed. Today, to cope with the fast-changing security landscape, we need to be able to transform huge data lakes via security analytics and big data technologies into effective security intelligence presented through a security \"cockpit\" to achieve a better corporate security and compliance level, support sound risk management and informed decision making. We present a high-level architecture for efficient security intelligence and the concept of a security cockpit as a point of control for the corporate security and compliance state. Therefore, we could conclude nowadays corporate security can be perceived as a big-data problem.",

Load balancing of data processing takes a very important place in cloud computing for several years. Load balancing on cloud systems is critical problem that is difficult to cope with, especially on the emerging heterogeneous clusters. In this aspect, we propose a threshold-based load balancing algorithm that balances the load among datacenters in cloud environments as well as minimizing remote communication among datacenters. The proposed approach is divided into two phases. Firstly, we specify the load threshold of each datacenter based on its processing speed and storage capacity. Secondly, we maintain load balancing among datacenters based on this threshold while the proposed approach takes into consideration the heterogeneity of datacenters. The results show that our approach improve efficiently the load balancing among datacenters.",

Firstly, according to the number of books borrowed from different stacks, we come up with some ideas to optimize the library floor set and make reasonable use of resources. Secondly, Based on the analysis of borrowing time, we make some suggestions to optimize the management of borrowing books. Finally, according to the types of books of the most borrowed, we put forward some suggestions to optimized collection books of library.",

This multi-case study of Australia, Ireland, Mexico, and U.S.A. examines the state of big data and big data analytics use in the national census context. The census agencies are at varying stages in digitally transforming their national census process, products and services through assimilating and using big data and big data analytics. The cross-case analysis of government websites and documents identified emerging agency challenges in creating public value in the national census context: (1) big data analytics capability development, (2) cross agency data access and data integration, and (3) data security, privacy & trust. Based on the insights gained, a research model aims to postulate the possible links among challenges, big data/big data analytics use, and public value creation.",

Although Hadoop is designed to deal with demands of storage and analysis of ever-growing Data, its performance characteristics are still to improve. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed to enhance Hadoop capabilities. Nevertheless, an overview of these approaches shows that several aspects need to be improved in terms of performance and data relevancy. The main challenge is how to extract efficiently value from the big data sources. For this purpose, we propose in this paper to discuss Hadoop architecture and intelligent data discovery, and propose an effective on-demand Big Data contribution enabling to process relevant data in efficient and effective way according to the stakeholder's needs, and aiming to boost Data appointment by integrating multidimensional approach.",

Automatic bone age evaluation is an example of the implementation of this technology in the medical field. The automated assessment is done based on the left-hand X-ray images. This assessment helps the radiologist and pediatrician evaluate children's growth. A system that can generate a precise and reliable prediction is essential. Thus the main challenge is to determine the suitable technology that can generate a reliable forecast, mainly when working with a large quantity of data. Big data is a growing trend; practical computing challenges created by data streams can be found in several types of applications. It is known that data streams are usually obtained from sensors and monitors which accumulatively can make data very large in volume. This can result in the inability of real-time processing to be carried out. In this paper, the data stream technique is utilized to assess and predict bone ages. The analysis process is carried out in real-time when the data arrives so that the process of storing new data is done after the data is analyzed. A 9 GB sized-dataset consisting of 12,611 images were used. The images have various resolutions. We extracted and analyzed image features by using Canny Edge feature extraction. To predict bone age from those extracted features, we enhance the data stream mining technique base on tree stream mining. We use MAE or Mean Absolute Error, RMSE or Root Mean Squared Error, and MAPE or Mean Absolute Percentage Error as metrics in this measurement. The outcomes of our experiment show that our approach in data stream mining can increase performance measurements. The MAPE of our approach gives a 7% lower error evaluation compared to the standard method.",

To facilitate studies on this huge GitHub data volume, the GHTorrent web-site publishes a MYSQL dump of (some) GitHub data quarterly. Unfortunately, developers using these published data dumps face challenges with respect to the time required to parse and ingest the data, the space required to store it, and the latency of their queries. To help address these challenges, we developed a data adaptor as an Eclipse plugin, which efficiently handles this dump. The plugin offers an interactive interface through which users can explore and select any field in any table. After extracting the data selected by the user, the parser exports it in easy-to-use spreadsheets. We hope that using this plugin will facilitate further studies on the GitHub data as a whole.",

Since the value of data explodes when it can be linked and fused with other data, addressing the big data integration (BDI) challenge is critical to realizing the promise of Big Data. BDI differs from traditional data integration in many dimensions: (i) the number of data sources, even for a single domain, has grown to be in the tens of thousands, (ii) many of the data sources are very dynamic, as a huge amount of newly collected data are continuously made available, (iii) the data sources are extremely heterogeneous in their structure, with considerable variety even for substantially similar entities, and (iv) the data sources are of widely differing qualities, with significant differences in the coverage, accuracy and timeliness of data provided. This talk explores the progress that has been made by the data integration community in addressing these novel challenges faced by big data integration, and identifies a range of open problems for the community.",

Community detection has been getting lots of attention and interest in recent years. The application for such knowledge goes from target marketing to biology, social studies, and physics. The existing algorithms either lack accuracy or are too slow for Big Data graphs. Due to the rise of Big Data graphs, such solutions prove impractical for real-world datasets. In this study, we change the feed system for the Label Propagation algorithm from a random method to a degree-based system. In addition, we introduce a new convergence method that checks the membership for every node and flags them as converged when they meet the requirement. The main contributions of this work are twofold: (i) we optimize the Label Propagation algorithm, improving the accuracy by a factor of two. The results depend on the complexity of the graph; i.e. the denser a graph structure is, the better result the algorithm will achieve. (ii) We solved the inconsistency of identified communities of Label Propagation algorithm. The results are depicted using two well-known metrics known as the Normalized Mutual Information and the Adjusted Rand Index. We present that Optimized Label Propagation has better results in various real-world dataset and artificial datasets.",

While many data-level and algorithm-level methods exist for treating label noise, the challenges associated with big data call for new and improved methods. This survey addresses these concerns by providing an extensive literature review on treating label noise within big data. We begin with an introduction to the class label noise problem and traditional methods for treating label noise. Next, we present 30 methods for treating class label noise in a range of big data contexts, i.e. high volume, high variety, and high velocity problems. The surveyed works include distributed solutions capable of operating on data sets of arbitrary sizes, deep learning techniques for large-scale data sets with limited clean labels, and streaming techniques for detecting class noise in the presence of concept drift. Common trends and best practices are identified in each of these areas, implementation details are reviewed, empirical results are compared across studies when applicable, and references to 17 open-source projects and programming packages are provided. An emphasis on label noise challenges, solutions, and empirical results as they relate to big data distinguishes this work as a unique contribution that will inspire future research and guide machine learning practitioners.",

It helps avoid performance bottleneck and data analytics latency at the central server of a Cloud. However, when Fog computing is deployed, the edge nodes are responsible in data analysis including learning and recognizing patterns from the incoming data streams. Hence it is crucial to find appropriate data mining algorithm(s) which is lightweight in operation and accurate in predictive performance. In this paper, the suitability of data mining and data stream mining algorithms are investigated in Fog computing environment. Specifically, non-black-box machine learning models such as decision trees are looked into, with a quick pre-processing function implemented by correlation-based feature selection algorithm coupled with traditional search methods and particle swarm optimization search method. The simulation is based on an IoT environment where emergency services are to be supported. The results of this paper sheds light into what/which algorithms should be designed and chosen for delivering edge intelligence under Fog computing environment.",

Innovation and entrepreneurship teachers should play the roles of \"big\" maker, \"small\" maker and guide. They should encourage every student to solve practical problems by means of big data and other information technology innovation, and provide targeted guidance for students.",

Data scientists are expected to have a wide range of technical skills alongside being passionate self-directed people who are able to work easily with others and deliver high quality outputs under pressure. There are hundreds of university, commercial, and online courses in data science and related topics. Apart from people with breadth and depth of knowledge and experience in data science, we identify a new educational path to train \"bridge persons\" who combine knowledge of an organization's business with sufficient knowledge and understanding of data science to \"bridge\" between non-technical people in the business with highly skilled data scientists who add value to the business. The increasing proliferation of big data and the great advances made in data science do not herald in an era where all problems can be solved by deep learning and artificial intelligence. Although data science opens up many commercial and social opportunities, data science must complement other science in the search for new theory and methods to understand and manage our complex world.",

Locally, over the past five years, we have also been working on varying fronts. Among our contributions are: (1) establishing a vision for a database-inspired big data analytics system, which unifies the best of database and distributed systems technologies, and augments it with concepts drawn from compilers (e.g., iterations) and data stream processing, as well as (2) forming a community of researchers and institutions to create the Stratosphere platform to realize our vision. One major result from these activities was Apache Flink, an open-source big data analytics platform and its thriving global community of developers and production users. Although much progress has been made, when looking at the overall big data stack, a major challenge for database research community still remains. That is, how to maintain the ease-of-use despite the increasing heterogeneity and complexity of data analytics, involving specialized engines for various aspects of an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, including, among others, graph-based, linear algebra-based, and relational-based algorithms, and the underlying, increasingly heterogeneous hardware and computing infrastructure. At TU Berlin, DFKI, and the Berlin Big Data Center (BBDC), we aim to advance research in this field via the Mosaics project. Our goal is to remedy some of the heterogeneity challenges that hamper developer productivity and limit the use of data science technologies to just the privileged few, who are coveted experts.",

How to use big data, artificial intelligence and other technologies to evaluate the quality of power data is a hot research topic in the field of electric power. At present, most of the power data quality evaluation methods are simple and lack the research of general data quality evaluation model. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data quality evaluation model based on a multi-head attention mechanism. The model measures multiple indicators such as completeness, accuracy, smoothness, and correlation. The corresponding methods are used to quantify these indicators to form a data quality evaluation index system oriented to multi-dimensional indicators; then, an application feedback mechanism based on a multi-head attention network is used to correct the calculation weights and score outputs, so as to achieve the evaluation of power data quality. Finally, the validation analysis is carried out based on the electricity data of a region in China. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the quality of electric power data.",

As the datasets often available in many disciplines and application areas exponentially grow thanks to the increasing availability of novel sensors and devices, there is nowadays an urgent need to develop novel methods and computational approaches to deal with the high volumes and variety of the large data sources generated in many fields. The range of research challenges still opened are extremely large, from the integration, storage, manipulation, data mining and visualization techniques to the development of computing architectures, cloud and distributed computing platforms to scalable storage systems. Clearly, big data challenges should require multidisciplinary approaches, when different points of view, ideas and experiences should be shared, this favoring exchanges and cross-fertilization on recent trends as well as research directions to consider.",

                "abstract": "Big Data may reside on multiple and dispersed sources and adhere to a variety of formats. Their analysis may include a range of tasks to be executed on a range of query engines. The tasks, as a whole, represent the rationale of a specific process. The users that create such a process may have various roles, like, business analysts, engineers, end-users etc. Each role may need or care for a different level of abstraction with respect to the execution of the individual tasks and overall process. Therefore, it is necessary to enable the expression of analytics tasks in an abstract manner, adaptable to the user role, interest and expertise. We propose a framework for the expression and preparation for execution of complex processes that perform analytics on Big Data. The framework enables the expression of such processes in the form of workflows and prepares such workflows for execution by determining and clarifying execution semantics of individual tasks, and by manipulating the workflow in order to create an equivalent workflow that will be optimally executed alone or together with other workflows.",

However, how well such application can support and effect managerial decision making still remains a challenge. From a case study of a traditional business in adopting new technology, it was found that an underlying issue that impeded effective and efficient managerial decision making lied in the human computer interaction process, and the design of the system user interface can be the culprit. With the rise of big data revolution, it seems that this underlying issue has still not been resolved for the applications to best support the executive users. This paper therefore shares research findings and developments in the social media and human language technology, and suggests employing adaptive user interfaces for big data applications to better support managerial decision making.",

                "abstract": "In our increasingly digitized world almost everything we do creates a record that is stored somewhere, whether we are purchasing a book, calling a friend, ordering a meal, or renting a movie. And in today's world of sensors and internet-enabled devices, smartphones and wearables, this is no longer just limited to our online activities. Exercising in the park, shopping for groceries, falling asleep, or even taking a shower, are just some of the everyday real-world activities that are likely to generate data. This is the big data world of the so-called Sensor Web. It is enabled by the widescale availability of high-performance computing, always-on communications, and mobile computing devices that come equipped with a variety of powerful sensors. This provides for a powerful computing and sensing ecosystem with important applications across all aspects of how we live, work, and play.The primary challenge for us now is to understand how we can (and whether we should) use this information. On the one hand, the promise of big data analytics is better decisions: better decisions about where we might live or where to send our kids to school; better decisions about the food we eat and the exercise we should take; and better decisions about some of the biggest choices facing modern societies when it comes to health, education, energy, and climate. On the other hand, this potential has a darker side, in the form of a gradual erosion of personal privacy as businesses and even governments seek to exploit our personal data for their own purposes, often without our informed consent.What is certain is that the combination of mobile computation, cheap but powerful sensors, and big data analytics points to new ways of thinking about some of society's toughest challenges. But to take advantage of these benefits we must reconcile the promise of big data with the pitfalls of privacy. Only then can these technologies can have a meaningful impact on how we can all benefit from the big data revolution as part of a healthier, safer, fairer world.",

Data extractions need focus on priority of data selection to reduce impact of 4Vs because of requirement of real-time computation. Corresponding big data-streaming for three-stage extraction system is presented in terms of hierarchal base and fuzzy representations. The proposed approach is based on a combination of clustering, classification and relationships method with fuzzy weighted similarity under hierarchical feature-based model. Moreover, heuristic fuzzy CBR-FDT- algorithms are provided to explore the target data optimization. Successful case study and experiment with simulations demonstrated the performance of the proposed approach.",

In this tutorial, we use the term Big Data to refer to any data processing need that requires a high degree of parallelism. In other words, we focus primarily on the \"volume\" and \"velocity\" aspects.As part of this tutorial, we will cover some aspects of Big Data management, in particular scalable storage, scalable query processing, and scalable transaction processing.This is an introductory tutorial for those who are not familiar with the areas that we will be covering.

In the argument, it is found that there are legal problems such as doubtful illegality, regulatory gaps that belong to the intersection of multiple laws, and difficulty in obtaining evidence. And because of the profit-seeking nature of the platform economy, the unconsciousness of algorithms and the uniqueness of the platform market structure, the boundaries between big-data price discrimination and reasonable marketing strategies are difficult to decide. It is not possible to totally prohibit big-data price discrimination and hinder the development of the new business model of the platform economy. However, when the platform's profit-seeking behavior infringes on the market order and consumer rights, big-data price discrimination is legally accountable. On one side, big-data price discrimination may infringe consumers’ fair trading rights, and the judgment criteria should be determined based on cost and profit rate. On the other side, in the anti-monopoly law, the boundary between reasonable transaction habits and legally accountable differential treatment should be distinguished for big-data price discrimination.",

                "abstract": "Proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor technology has expedited the realization of Smart City. To enable necessary functions, sensors distributed across the city generate a huge volume of stream data that are crucial for controlling Smart City devices. However, due to conditions such as wears and tears, battery drain, or malicious attacks, not all data are reliable even when they are accurately measured. These data could lead to invalid and devastating consequences (e.g., failed utility or transportation services). The assessment of data reliability is necessary and challenging especially for Smart City, as it has to keep up with velocity of big data stream to provide up-to-date results. Most research on data reliability has focused on data fusion and anomaly detection that lack a quantified measure of how much the data over a period of time are adequately reliable for decision-makings. This paper alleviates these issues and presents an online approach to assessing Big stream data reliability in a timely manner. By employing a well-studied evidence-based theory, our approach provides a computational framework that assesses data reliability in terms of belief likelihoods. The framework is lightweight and easy to scale, deeming fit for streaming data. We evaluate the approach using a real application of light sensing data of 1,323,298 instances. The preliminary results are consistent with logical rationales, confirming validity of the approach.",

The introduction of the internet and PCs, first of all, cell phones and later smartphones, has changed our daily habits, leading us to be always connected for many hours of the day. Changes that have affected all fields, not least sporting activity, always focused on performance maximization. Technology in sport has made great strides, allowing both amateurs and even more professionals to use innovative technical solutions that can improve performance: first of all during training and then, consequently, in official competitions. Innovations both in the field of materials, but above all in terms of tools for verifying correct training through the collection of a large number of data, turned into carefully analysed useful information. There are sports that have benefited most from these new technologies, based on their particular characteristics. This research focused on a systematic analysis of the most important technologies that are currently allowing great progress in sports performance and in the impartiality of competitions through the analysis of the collected data. In particular, the research highlighted three particular areas of interest: a) video assistant data collectors; b) Wearable technologies; c) Scouting tech-based techniques.",

This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities.The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research.",

This laboratory simulates the real-world shopping environment, allows big data generation and collection from various kinds of shopping activities. Data were captured from the service users who are having their technical and business training in a controlled setting environment. Consumer behavior modeling will be described, technical detail such as environment construction, theory, logic, framework, infrastructure, and architecture will also be discussed in this paper. Preliminary results showed that both \"holding time\" and the \"frequency on the spots\" have a certain relationship to the purchase decision which made by the consumer (i.e. service user in the laboratory): the longer stay time where the service user is located, the higher chances that the product(s) will be purchased.",

A systematic review of the literature suggests that it is a minority practice to even explicitly discuss data quality.

Therefore, how to monitor the large scale network traffic effectively has become an important challenge for network security management. Aiming at it, we propose a new network monitoring system where Netflow as the monitoring object based on big data technology, which has four main functions: it can use Filebeat to collect Netflow in real time; it transfers the data reliably based on Logstash; it stores the data in ElasticSearch, it analyzes and displays the data in real time through Kabana. The experimental results show that our system is capable of meeting millisecond responses to 100 million of Netflows. It can meet the requirements of real-time monitoring for large-scale network traffic, and provide the basis for network security control.",

                "abstract": "In this talk we first present an introduction to AsterixDB [1], a parallel, semistructured platform to ingest, store, index, query, analyze, and publish \"big data\" (http://asterixdb.ics.uci.edu) and the various challenges we addressed while building it. AsterixDB combines ideas from semistructured data management, parallel database systems, and first-generation data-intensive computing platforms (MapReduce and Hadoop). The full AsterixDB software stack provides support for big data applications from the storage and processing engine (Hyracks [2] available at: http://hyracks.googlecode.com), to the exible query optimization layer (Algebricks), to the interfaces for user-level interaction (AQL, HiveQL, Pregelix, etc.) Hyracks is a partitioned-parallel engine for data intensive computing jobs in the form of DAGs. Algebricks is a model-agnostic, algebraic layer for compiling and optimizing parallel queries to be processed by Hyracks. Queries for AsterixDB can be expressed by either popular higher-level data analysis languages like Pig, Hive or Jaql, or by its native query language (AQL) and data model (ADM) with support for semi-structured information and fuzzy data.Fundamental data processing operations, like joins and aggregations, are natively supported in AsterixDB. The second part of the talk focuses on our experiences while designing efficient local (per node) aggregation algorithms for AsterixDB. In particular, there are two challenges for local aggregations in a big data system: first, if the aggregation is group-based (like the \"group-by\" in SQL), the aggregation result may not fit in main memory; second, in order to allow multiple operations being processed simultaneously, an aggregation operation should work within a strict memory budget provided by the platform. Despite its importance and challenges, the design and evaluation of local aggregation algorithms has not received the same level of attention that other basic operators, such as joins, have received in the literature. Facing a lack of \"off the shelf\" local aggregation algorithms for big data, we present low-level implementation details for engineering the aggregation operator, utilizing (i) sort-based, (ii) hash-based, and (iii) sort-hash-hybrid approaches. We present six algorithms all of which work within a strictly bounded memory budget, and can easily adapt between in-memory and external processing. Among them, two are novel and four are based on extending existing join algorithms.We deployed all algorithms as operators in the Hyracks platform and evaluated their performance through extensive experimentation. Our experiments cover many different performance factors, including input cardinality, memory, data distribution, and hash table structure. Our study guided our selection of the local aggregation algorithms supported in the recent release of AsterixDB, namely: the hybrid-hash. Pre-Partitioning algorithm for its tolerance on the estimation of the input grouping key cardinality, the Hash-Sort algorithm for its good performance when aggregating skewed data, and the Sort-Based algorithm when the input data is already sorted. This local aggregation work is the first part of a two-part big data aggregation study, as it addresses the \"map\" phase. Our findings provide the foundation for the global aggregation strategy we are currently investigating for the \"reduce\" phase. We hope our experience can help developers of other Big Data platforms to build a solid local aggregation operator.",

                "abstract": "Big Data has nowadays become the most talked latest IT trends. The fact that it can handle all the forms of data which includes unstructured data, big data has now become the preferred choice for analysis of huge amount of data over the Relational Database Management System(RDBMS). Big Data is helpful for the analysis of petabytes of data which is not possible in case of normal database system. But as everything comes with pros and cons so does big data. There are certain challenges which big data analytics is facing. The various challenges include validating the end point input, handling enormous amount of data on a very large scale, ensuring the security of transactional data, ensuring the safe and secure storage of data, sharing of variants of data with third party and analyzing those data without skipping even a single piece of information in order to generate reports and draw a conclusion. In this paper, we will be considering the major challenge to the big data and that is data security. Even with enormous advantages, the industry is taking a backseat for the shift from normal database to big data because of the data privacy concern. Even many big organizations don't consider big data to be a safe option as the data can be accessed by anyone. Certain different methods like the encryption-decryption technique, anonymization based, etc have been suggested by the researchers who are working to overcome the major threat of Big Data i.e. Data security. But unfortunately because of the 3 V's of the Big Data as stated by Gartner i.e. Velocity, Volume and Variety these methods didn't prove to be advantageous. Basically in this paper we will be discussing the various concern issues of Big data, out of which our main focus will be on data security.",

Evolution of market structure in combination with advances in computer technologies led to emergence of electronic securities trading. Securities transactions that used to be conducted in person and over the phone are now predominantly executed by automated trading systems. This resulted in significant fragmentation of the markets, vast increase in the exchange volumes and even greater increase in the number of orders.In this talk we present and analyze forces behind the wide proliferation of electronic securities trading in US stocks and options markets. We also make a high-level introduction into electronic securities market structure. We discuss trading objectives of different classes of market participants and analyze how their activity affects data volumes. We also present typical securities trading firm data flow and analyze various types of data it uses in its trading operations.We close with the implications this \"sea change\" has on DBMS requirements in capital markets.",

In this paper, CiteSpace citation analysis software is used as an analysis tool and big data related literature in the Web of Science core database during 2011- 2021 is used as an analysis object. The major task is to create the knowledge map of big data with multi-dimension, build knowledge graphs of big data from several perspectives and develop visual analyses of the literature. From the sight of time and space. Differences between the numbers and the research contents of literature on big data published by different countries, regions, and institutions have been analyzed and compared; By co-cited literature, the classical papers and core literature in the field of big data have been detected, and the development context of big data domain have been clarified; Cluster analysis has been conducted on hot keywords to find the research hotspots of big data domain in recent years. Burst words detection algorithm has been used to track the research frontiers and development trends in the field of big data. The results show that China has surpassed the developed countries in Europe and the United States in the number of literature on big data. However, there is still a lack of core technology literature. The development of big data and AI will be in the same direction and depend on each other; The improvement of deep learning algorithms based of big data analysis is going to become a frontier research topic in a long-term; The integration of big data and all walks of life should to be deepened, and researchers need to find the breakthrough points for the application of big data based on the characteristics of the industry.",

A reference architecture enables these software engineering activities by standardizing nomenclature, defining key solution elements and their relationships, collecting relevant solution patterns, and classifying existing technologies. Within the national security domain, existing reference architectures for big data systems have not been useful because they are too general or are not vendor-neutral. We present a reference architecture for big data systems that is focused on addressing typical national defence requirements and that is vendor-neutral, and we demonstrate how to use this reference architecture to define solutions in one mission area.",

Experimental results confirm that the prediction performance has been significantly improved by using a large volume of training data, a large variety of features from both business support systems (BSS) and operations support systems (OSS), and a high velocity of processing new coming data. We have deployed this churn prediction system in one of the biggest mobile operators in China. From millions of active customers, this system can provide a list of prepaid customers who are most likely to churn in the next month, having $0.96$ precision for the top $50000$ predicted churners in the list. Automatic matching retention campaigns with the targeted potential churners significantly boost their recharge rates, leading to a big business value.",

                "abstract": "The collection and analysis of relevant data for evaluating public policies is not a straightforward task. An important type of such studies is the so-called ex-post evaluation. The main objective of ex-post evaluations is to determine to what extent a realized intervention is successful in tackling a societal challenge, e.g., youth unemployment. At a first glance an obvious method is to collect some baseline measurements for a set of relevant variables, apply the intervention for a while and collect the new measurement values for the same set of variables. Then, comparing the measurement values of the variables before and after the intervention provides an insight into the extent of successfulness of the intervention. This, however, is only true if the \"ceteris paribus\" condition holds. In practice it is infeasible to enforce this condition for societal challenges. Often, after having the baseline measurements, several phenomena emerge that may impact the new measurements without being taken into account. This makes it difficult to determine how much of the measured differences between the values of the variables before and after the intervention should be attributed to the emerging phenomena (or the so-called counterfactuals) and how much of the differences can be attributed to the applied intervention.This paper discusses how exploiting big data may contribute to the task of elucidating the influences of counterfactuals (and interventions) in ex-post evaluation studies. The paper proposes a framework to utilize big data for accounting for the impact of emerging phenomena in ex-post evaluation studies.",

Big Data analytics has been relevant in the industry due to the need to convert information into knowledge. Among the challenge of big data is the creation of strategies to improve the execution costs of running machine learning models to make a prediction. Apache Spark is a powerful in-memory platform that offers an extensive machine learning library for regression, classification, clustering, and rule extraction. This investigation, from a computation cost perspective, performs different experiments using real datasets. The main contribution of the paper is to compare the execution time of different machine learning models, such as random forests, decision tree, logistic regression, linear support vector machine, and kNN. The present work expects to combine the areas of big data and machine learning, comparing the results with different configurations and the use of the optimization methods, cache and persist. The evaluation experiments show that logistic regression performed the shortest execution time of the Spark MLlib models.",

The paper aims to provide a theoretical contribution to the research stream on the topic, by further exploring the emergent properties and understandings related to the role of CIO. As a consequence of the need to adopt advanced technologies, the CIO has been named to master the current unheard information growth for business innovation. To this end we present the results of a qualitative research based on grounded theory carried out on data concerning CIOs of medium and large companies from different industries in the Italian market. Finally, a substantive theory and categories are discussed, showing the role of generation gap and power of new entrants as well as of project and execution excellence on the making of identity and recognition of the CIO as relevant at the time of Big Data analytics.",

Using the mentioned target set, the algorithm gives an estimation of the closeness of any pair of nodes in the graph. Personalized Page Vector is used to find the most popular nodes, also known as hubs, in the network. The time taken by the estimation of Personalized PageRank is directly proportional to the network size. In this work, we proposed a node reduction method to prune the graph. To decrease the entropy and reduce the number of alternate paths to the target nodes, redundant popular nodes are identified and flagged. The flagged nodes are, then, given a lower priority in the computation. After pruning the graph, estimation results achieve an improved time complexity. The proposed method achieves a twice shorter computation time as compared to FAST PPR and Local Update.",

                "abstract": "The benefits of deriving useful insights from avalanche of data available everywhere cannot be overemphasized. Big Data analytics can revolutionize the healthcare industry. It can also ensure functional productivity, help forecast and suggest feedbacks to disease outbreaks, enhance clinical practice, and optimize healthcare expenditure which cuts across all stakeholders in healthcare sectors. Notwithstanding these immense capabilities available in the general application of big data; studies on derivation of useful insights from healthcare data that can enhance medical practice have received little academic attention. Therefore, this study highlighted the possibility of making very insightful healthcare outcomes with big data through a simple classification problem which classifies the tendency of individuals towards specific drugs based on personality measures. Our model though trained with less than 2000 samples and with a simple neural network architecture achieved mean accuracies of 76.87% (sd=0.0097) and 75.86% (sd=0.0123) for the 0.15 and 0.05 validation sets respectively. The relatively acceptable performance recorded by our model despite the small dataset could largely be attributed to number of attributes in our dataset. It is essential to uncover some of the many complexities in our societies in relations to healthcare; and through many machine learning architectures like the neural networks these complex relationships can be discovered",

The wireless sensor network (WSN) system can provide real-time and reliable big data for the intelligent transportation system, but the power supply of the wireless sensor node is a difficult point that restricts its wide application. This study will use the piezoceramic to converts vibration energy in the surroundings into voltage output. The power management module can meet the energy requirements of MEMS devices such as wireless sensor nodes, wireless monitoring modules, accelerometers and so on. Using piezoceramic as energy supply, the total mass, speed and wheelbase of vehicles can be potentially measured through systematic layout, which is to achieve self-powered demand. The acceleration and temperature sensors can be used to record acceleration information and surface temperature data of the vehicle respectively. A wireless sensor node is established in unit of a wireless transmission module, and a wireless sensor network is further formed. The data obtained by the wireless sensor network is processed in the server to obtain traffic information such as traffic volume, vehicle type and overspeed in different sections in real time, which provides powerful and accurate data support for the planning and decision-making of the intelligent transportation system.",

Big Data and its application have been a target for European Commission -- with more than 100 FP7 and about 50 H2020 funded projects under Big Data domain. GATE project aims to establish and sustain in the long run a Centre of Excellence as collaborative environment for conducting Big Data research and innovation, facilitated by GATE platform and Innovation Labs. This paper proposes a conceptual architecture of GATE platform, that is holistic, symbiotic, open, evolving and data-integrated. It is also modular and with component-based design that allows to position a mix of products and tools from different providers. GATE platform will enable start-ups, SMEs and large enterprises, as well as other organizations in a wide range of sectors, to build advanced Data driven services and applications. The usability of the proposed architecture is proven through a development of a sample time series data visualization application. Its architecture follows the proposed one through implementation of required components using open technology stack.",

Taking K-means algorithm as an example, this paper proposes a compression-aware performance improvement model for big-data clustering. The model quantitatively analyzes the effect of a variety of factors related to compression during the entire computational process. We perform clustering experiments on 10 dimensional data with up to 1.114 TB in size on a cluster computer with hundreds of computing cores. The measurement validates that using compression contributes significantly to improving the I/O performance, and confirms our theoretical analysis empirically. Furthermore, the proposed model can effectively determine when and how to use compression to improve I/O performance for big-data analysis.",

To support an economically oriented management of data quality and decision making under uncertainty, it is essential to assess the data quality level by means of well-founded metrics. However, if not adequately defined, these metrics can lead to wrong decisions and economic losses. Therefore, based on a decision-oriented framework, we present a set of five requirements for data quality metrics. These requirements are relevant for a metric that aims to support an economically oriented management of data quality and decision making under uncertainty. We further demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of these requirements by evaluating five data quality metrics for different data quality dimensions. Moreover, we discuss practical implications when applying the presented requirements.",

We employ an RDF store to index the semantic information extracted from large document collections and a natural language to SPARQL conversion module to find desired information. In order to be able to find answers to complex questions in structured/unstructured data resources, our system produces rich semantic structures from the data resources and then transforms the extracted knowledge into an RDF representation. In order to facilitate easy access to the information stored in the RDF semantic index, our system accepts a user's natural language questions, translates them into SPARQL queries and returns a precise answer back to the user. Our improvements in performance over a regular free text search index-based question answering engine prove that SQA can benefit greatly from the addition and consumption of deep semantic information.",

In recent years, as the importance of data has increased, data that have been provided free of charge, such as existing social networks, have become available, and the supply period is being limited. Commercialization of data is a continuous process in all over the world; therefore, the data industry, which collects, processes, analyzes, predicts, and provides data is expected to be more active. In this research, using the universal resource locator (URL)and application programming interface (API) of the dataset provided by various public and personal data providers, we propose an automatic database building and visualization platform that can automatically convert the collected data into database (DB), regardless of the data format. Particularly, it is possible to restructure the dataset on the proposed platform, which allows the user to select only the necessary items in the collected dataset and visualize the data set by fusing it.",

Fact, a number of researchers have discussed this problem by adopting several techniques that can detect plagiarism. Nevertheless, most of these techniques are still insufficient for the detection of intelligent plagiarism, which still needs to be improved. In this paper, we give an overview of the best-known methods of detection of plagiarism that exist. We start with defining the concept of plagiarism and its various forms most used by plagiarists. A thorough study of these approaches is then carried out, by establishing a comparative table of these approaches according to several criteria. Moreover, we finish by defining the concept of big data as well as one of these techniques that called Text mining, which applied in the phase of extraction of documents sources for plagiarism detection.",

The quantity of access cannot meet demand, the standard of access is inaccurate and the evaluation of post-access is passive. This leads to mismatch between supply and demand, as well as lack of liquidity in indemnificatory housing. It should introduce the big data credit evaluation system into the management of indemnificatory housing access, so as to create a binding access credit environment, balance supply and demand, and promote the utilization of housing resources. Specifically, big data platform of national social security credit should be constructed. The \"funnel type\" information sharing mechanism and \"dynamic assessment+ active early warning\" mechanism also should be constructed. In addition, the multi-dimensional big data credit evaluation measure index should be formed.",

For example, in financial field, users often use big data analysis services to analyze stocks, assets, and accounts in real-time investment decision-making. Therefore, real-time service response is very important from the perspective of user experience. Caching data and analysis results have been used widely in industrial practice. But these caches generally are passive, rigid and inefficient. Proactive caching approach for time-consuming data services is a worthwhile research problem. In addition, we have encountered this problem in a practical enterprise application. In this paper, we propose a data service request prediction approach based on historical user behavior time series analysis. Results show that this approach can improve the response speed of backend data services effectively.",

We then examine the detailed implementation of big data in each public policy stage. The experiments or practical applications from the relevant literature demonstrate how exactly big data is used to improve policy analysis. This study will guide governments on adopting big data for public policy analysis.",

To evaluate the impact we used information from the X-culture project database that was collected through various surveys and conducted an interview with students. According to the results received students skills developed significantly after the participation in the project. Also we implemented a correlation analysis to determine weather students' critical-thinking, problem-solving, collaborative and digital skills affected the final reports scores on the international project. In our case collaborative skills played the most substantial role for getting the highest final reports scores while the relationship between digital skills and reports' results was the weakest.",
