However, when complex data mining algorithms are required, their fully scalable deployment on such platforms faces a number of technical challenges that grow with the complexity of the algorithms involved. Thus algorithms, that were originally designed for a sequential nature, must often be redesigned in order to effectively use the distributed computational resources. In this paper, we explore these problems, and then propose a solution which has proven to be very effective on the complex hierarchical clustering algorithm CLUBS+. By using four stages of successive refinements, CLUBS+ delivers high-quality clusters of data grouped around their centroids, working in a totally unsupervised fashion. Experimental results confirm the accuracy and scalability of CLUBS+.",

There is no wonder that this epoch is generally characterized as the “Era of Big Data”. Thus, many enterprises and research initiatives strive to find a way to effectively and efficiently collect, store and analyze Big Data in order to improve their services and make efficient decisions. Those approaches refer to several domains such as healthcare, transportation, governance, or insurance. Towards this direction, in this paper we contribute into the selection of the most appropriate database for efficiently storing and retrieving Big Data. More specifically, taking into account the nature of Big Data and the main categories of databases that currently exist, three (3) NoSQL document-based databases were considered for this comparative study, namely the ArangoDB, the MongoDB and the CouchDB. The performance of these databases was measured based on specific metrics and criteria, including the total execution time for the same CRUD operations and their corresponding demands for resources, concluding to the most suitable database for storing Big Data.",

There are also high-dimension, high-redundancy, and high-correlation issues among indexes. Based on the above background, a two-layer Autoencoder neural network is used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Then, 10 deep neural network models are established for index learning. The experimental results show that the 32-layer Resent network works best for low-dimensional data effectiveness evaluation.",

Existing detection methods should be enhanced in order to effectively deal with today's malware. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time monitoring, analysis and detection approach that is achieved by applying big data analytics and machine learning in the development of a general detection model. The learnings achieved through big data render machine learning more efficient. Using the deep learning approach, we designed and developed a scalable detection model that brings improvement to the existing solutions. Our experiments achieved an accuracy of 97% and ROC of 0.99.",

Cluster validation aims to assess the quality of partitions obtained by clustering algorithms. Several indexes have been developed for cluster validation purpose. They can be external or internal depending on the availability of ground truth clustering. This paper deals with the issue of cluster validation of large data set. Indeed, in the era of big data this task becomes even more difficult to handle and requires parallel and distributed approaches. In this work, we are interested in external validation indexes. More specifically, this paper proposes a model for purity based cluster validation in parallel and distributed manner using Map-Reduce paradigm in order to be able to scale with increasing dataset sizes.The experimental results show that our proposed model is valid and achieves properly cluster validation of large datasets.",

If the optimal solution is unable to attain or unnecessary or has a price to high to pay, it is reasonable to sacrifice optimality with a \"good\" feasible solution that can be computed efficiently. Existing approximation techniques can be in general classified into approximation algorithms, approximate query processing for aggregate SQL queries and approximation computing for multiple layers of the system stack. In this article, we systematically introduce approximate computation, i.e., query approximation and data approximation, for efficient and effective big data analytics. We explain the ideas and rationales behind query and data approximation, and show efficiency can be obtained with high effectiveness, and even without sacrificing for effectiveness, for certain data analytic tasks.",

In recent years, big data technology is gradually popularized and applied, which brings great convenience to people. But it also leads to many problems, one of which is the hidden danger of privacy leakage. The purpose of this paper is to find the possible causes of privacy leakage. Based on the research results of others, this study collected the data through the Internet and conducted some investigations. It can be concluded that there are three main reasons leading to big data privacy problems. First, individuals lack privacy protection awareness and awareness of the harm of privacy leakage. Second, enterprises lack legal awareness, do not protect the user's privacy, and even intentionally violate the law to intercept the user's privacy information. Third, with the development of data industry, government is required to update the privacy protection laws in time. Legal Research on how to protect users' privacy in big data has also been ignored.",

Improving energy efficiency, promoting environmental justice, tracking climate change, and monitoring water quality are just a few of the objectives being furthered by the use of Big Data. The authors provide a more detailed analysis of the emerging evidence-based insights on Environmental Big Data (EBD), by applying the well-defined method of systematic mapping. The analysis of results throws light on the current open issues of Environmental Big Data. Moreover, different facets of the study can be combined nto answer more specific research questions. The report reveals the need for more empirical research able to provide new metrics measuring efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed analytics and new methods and tools supporting data processing workflow in EBD",

At the same time, big data technology is developing rapidly, with the availability of various types of high-precision data being gradually increased. The combination of big data and urban design plays an important role in the urban design of transition period. This paper describes the design of urban education system under the big data platform. With the traditional teaching model, which include four stage (research, topic, design and expression), big data technologies are divided into four aspects to consider how to apply the big data to the teaching of urban design. Specifically summarized: big data \"accelerate\" researching, big data \"secondary\" analysis, big data \"enhanced\" design and big data of \"optimization\" expression. The aim of this research is to let the traditional teaching system and cutting-edge technology of large data collide with each other fusion, which can not only enrich the existing education system, but also establish a complete technical structure. On this basis, it can help students establish and improve the construction, and the ability to learn new technologies, to promote the progress of urban design techniques.",

While semantic integration can be provided through RDF generation, current generators insufficiently scale in terms of volume. Generators are limited by memory constraints. Therefore, we developed the RMLStreamer, a generator that parallelizes the ingestion and mapping tasks of RDF generation across multiple instances. In this paper, we analyze what aspects are parallelizable and we introduce an approach for parallel RDF generation. We describe how we implemented our proposed approach, in the frame of the RMLStreamer, and how the resulting scaling behavior compares to other RDF generators. The RMLStreamer ingests data at 50% faster rate than existing generators through parallel ingestion.",

Although the reliability of disk drives has greatly improved over the past few years, they are still the most vulnerable core components in the server. If they fail, the result can be catastrophic: it can take some days to recover data, sometimes data lost forever. These are unacceptable for some important data. XOR parity is a typical method to generate reliability syndrome, thus improving the reliability of the data. In practice, we find that the data is still likely to be lost. In most storage systems reliability improvements are achieved through the allocation of additional disks in Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID), which will increase the hardware costs, thus it will be very difficult for cost-constrained environments. Therefore, how to improve the data integrity without raising the hardware cost has aroused much interest of big data researchers. This challenge is when creating non-traditional RAID geometries, care must be taken to respect data dependence relationships to ensure that the new RAID strategy improves reliability, which is a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present an approach for characterizing these challenges using high-dimension variants of the n-queens problem that enables performable solutions via the SAT solver MiniSAT, and use the greedy algorithm to analyze the queen's attack domain, as a basis for reliability syndrome generation. A large number of experiments show that the approach proposed in this paper is feasible in software-defined data centers and the performance of the algorithm can meet the current requirements of the big data environment.",

The successes of business analytics in strategy, process optimization and competitive advantage has led to data being increasingly recognized as a valuable asset in many organizations. In recent years, thanks to a dramatic increase in the volume, variety and velocity of data, the loosely defined concept of \"Big Data\" has emerged as a topic of discussion in its own right -- with different viewpoints in both the business and technical worlds. From our perspective, it is important for discussions of \"Big Data\" to start from a well-defined business goal, and remain moored to fundamental principles of both cost/benefit analysis as well as core statistical science. This note discusses some business case considerations for analytics projects involving \"Big Data\", and proposes key questions that businesses should ask. With practical lessons from Big Data deployments in business, we also pose a number of research challenges that may be addressed to enable the business analytics community bring best data analytic practices when confronted with massive data sets.",

                "abstract": "Nowadays, the Internet has turned into a crucial piece of our cutting edge society. It is a stage of exploration, financial development, democratic participation and speech. The operations of the Internet have prompted a huge development and collection of information known as Big Data. Therefore, it is important to monitor and measure the Quality of Service (QoS) of Internet traffic. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory started the PingER project in 1995 to measure the End-to-End Internet performance history of servers and routers worldwide. The project involves measurements of the 700 monitored sites in over 160 countries. PingER Monitoring Agents (MAs) ping a list of monitored sites after every 30 minutes to obtain Round Trip Time (RTT) values revealing interesting information about Internet performance (e.g., RTT, jitter, packet loss and unreachability) major events (e.g., fiber cuts, earthquakes, and social upheavals). Thus, the project has collected a vast amount of historical Internet Performance data worldwide since 1995. Currently, the data is stored in flat text files, making it difficult to analyze collectively. In addition, this simplistic format limits the analytical potential of this data. In this paper, we propose an approach to process, store, analyze and visualize PingER data. A Data warehouse is created which combines Hadoop Big Data techniques. The data are processed by using Sci-cumulus MR workflow, stored in HDFS, analyzed by Impala queries and visualized by using Google API's. This approach makes PingER data more accessible and enhances its potential contribution to ongoing research and application development.",

With the help of the software CiteSpace, the visual analysis of the literature quantity, authors and institutions, keywords co-occurrence, keywords clustering and burst keywords were carried out respectively. The results show that the research on e-commerce big data in China first started in 2012 and entered a white-hot stage from 2013 to 2018. \"Precision marketing\", \"cloud computing\", \"Internet +\" and other fields are the main research hotspots at present. Observing the burst keywords in recent years, it is found that \"precision marketing\", \"cost control\", \"supply chain\" and \"optimization strategy\" may become the frontier hot spots and development trends of e-commerce big data research in the future.",

Currently, the Organizations have a new option to outsource their massive data in the cloud without having to worry about the size of data or the capacity of memory. However, moving confidential and sensitive data from trusted domain of the data owners to public cloud will cause various security and privacy risks. Furthermore, the increasing amount of big data outsourced in the cloud increases the chance of breaching the privacy and security of these data. Despite all the research that has been done in this area, big data storage security and privacy remains one of the major concerns of organizations that adopt the cloud computing and big data technologies. Thus to ensure better data security we need for focus on two major problems which are the access control and encryption policies.In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model that enhances the security and privacy of big data shared in cloud environment using an access control scheme based on KP-ABE and authentication system. Our approach provides a flexible fine-grained access control of big data stored and shared in the cloud computing such that the encrypted data can only be accessed by authorized users.",

To achieve the goal of a unified management of \"mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes and grasslands\", aiming at the current online value evaluation issue on the green development of ecological assets in urban areas. This paper probes into the various information and data resources from the ecological factors, completes a demand analysis of the basic platform of urban ecological factors, establishes a monitoring analysis system for urban green development ecological system, and constructs a green development ecological system digital monitoring platform with high digital integrity, strong analysis ability and accurate decision support. The construction of platform layer, cleaning, storage and operation modeling of data as well as data service, sharing and exchange of the platform, all help to solve the isolated data situation of various information systems, and lay a foundation for subsequent data mining value, and establishing a data-driven city. Besides, it also provides decision support for urban green development, and helps to further build a model green development city, and promote urban ecological civilization. Meanwhile, this Big Data platform could reflect real situation of ecological assets in a more scientific and rational way, and provide certain basis and reference for the off-office auditing of leading cadres in relevant posts of natural assets.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the direction Florida's single-family homes constructed between the years 2009 and 2018 are taking with respect to energy efficiency by analyzing their energy characteristics through big data analysis. Therefore, this study (a) developed a comprehensive literature review of the existing energy-efficient design strategies adopted in Florida. In addition, (b) explained the process of collecting information about materials and design strategies used in single-family houses constructed between the years 2009 and 2018, from energy forms prepared in the framework of the permit application process at every local building permit department in different counties all over Florida. Finally, (c) analyzed the evolution of information collected throughout the years, including but not limited to wall types, ceiling types, ducts' location, windows' features, heating and cooling systems, in the different climate zones of Florida influencing the building performance. The results of this big data analysis indicated that, on the average, single-family homes in Florida tended to get more energy-efficient and sustainable throughout the last decade (2009-2018). This conclusion cannot be totally confirmed unless all economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability are also taken into consideration.",

Therefore, enterprise big data management is currently an important compet- itiveness of enterprise development. By constructing a multi-dimensional enterprises knowledge graph, the article identifies hidden data characteristics in enterprises. Take enterprise risk monitoring as an example, our method provides a perspective for risk prevention and rational evaluation of enterprises from a macro perspective. Based on the perspective of knowledge graph theory, using the top-down construction method, the knowledge graph of the enterprise is constructed from five dimensions, and then the enterprise judicial risk and public opinion risk are found. The research shows that: the knowledge graph can help enterprises and its external personnel fully grasp enterprise information, provide accurate and reliable knowledge for enterprise growth, industry development, government supervision, market investment and other aspects, which has important research value for early detection and prevention of enterprise risk.",

As an important machine learning technique, Bayesian Network (BN) has been widely used to model probabilistic relationships among variables. To deal with the challenges of Big Data PN learning, we apply the techniques in distributed data-parallelism (DDP) and scientific workflow to the BN learning process. We first propose an intelligent Big Data pre-processing approach and a data quality score to measure and ensure the data quality and data faithfulness. Then, a new weight based ensemble algorithm is proposed to learn a BN structure from an ensemble of local results. To easily integrate the algorithm with DDP engines, such as Hadoop, we employ Kepler scientific workflow to build the whole learning process. We demonstrate how Kepler can facilitate building and running our Big Data BN learning application. Our experiments show good scalability and learning accuracy when running the application in real distributed environments.",

Decision makers often have psychological characteristics such as reference dependence, loss avoidance, and probability judgment distortion when making decisions. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-attribute group decision making method based on foreground theory and language decision information based on big data technology. The method makes full use of the qualitative and quantitative conversion characteristics of the cloud model, and solves the problems of ambiguity and randomness of emergency decision information. At the same time, based on the foreground theory, the influence of the psychological factors of the decision makers on the decision results is fully considered, and the emergency response is emergency. Management and decision making provide supplementary reference.",

With the advent of the era of big data, enterprises are more vulnerable to the risk of data privacy leakage when they are transmitting cross-border trade. In this paper, this phenomenon is investigated. Affected by the epidemic situation, we conducted in depth communication with nine different types of enterprises by means of cloud interview. After classifying them, about 30% of enterprises in each category are selected for empirical research through questionaires survey. The results show that the nine enterprises have a weak understanding of the existing laws on data privacy protection at home and abroad. Based on this, after the simulation experiment, this paper puts forward corresponding suggestions for enterprises and government departments, which has certain reference value for related enterprises to formulate privacy policies and strategies in China.",

However, it is necessary to consider that such amount of data is continuously increasing and it is necessary to deal with novel requirements related to variety, volume, velocity, and veracity issues. In this paper we focus on veracity that is related to the presence of uncertain or imprecise data: errors, missing or invalid data can compromise the usefulness of the collected values. In such a scenario, new methods and techniques able to evaluate the quality of the available data are needed. In fact, the literature provides many data quality assessment and improvement techniques, especially for structured data, but in the Big Data era new algorithms have to be designed. We aim to provide an overview of the issues and challenges related to Data Quality assessment in the Big Data scenario. We also propose a possible solution developed by considering a smart city case study and we describe the lessons learned in the design and implementation phases.",

In general, the goal is to collect all data from manufacturing systems comprehensively, in order to enable new findings and decision support by means of appropriate Industrial Big Data (IBD) analysis procedures. However, due to limited human and economic resources, potential IBD projects need to get prioritized -- in the best case according to their cost-benefit ratio. Available methods for this purpose are insufficient, due to their limited ability to be operationalized, error-proneness, and lack of scientific evidence. In this paper, we discuss how cost-benefit-analysis frameworks can be applied to the preliminary selection of production use cases for the implementation of BDT in larger production systems. It supports the use case selection process from information about production needs, available BDT, and given condition(s) per use case. This concept paper attempts to consolidate the hitherto fragmented discourse on how to prioritize IBD projects, evaluates the challenges of prioritization in this field, and presents a prioritization concept to overcome these challenges.",

Big Data Clouds is a new generation data analytics platform using Cloud computing as a back end technologies, for information mining, knowledge discovery and decision making based on statistical and empirical tools. MapReduce scheduling models for Big Data computing operate in the cluster mode, where the data nodes are pre-configured with the computing facility for processing. These MapReduce models are based on compute push model-pushing the logic to the data node for analysis, which is primarily for minimizing or eliminating data migration overheads between computing resources and data nodes. Such models, however, substantially perform well in the cluster setups, but are infelicitous for the platforms having the decoupled data storage and computing resources. In this paper, we propose a Genetic Algorithm based scheduler for such Big Data Cloud where decoupled computational and data services are offered as services. The approach is based on evolutionary methods focussed on data dependencies, computational resources and effective utilization of bandwidth thus achieving higher throughputs.",

                "abstract": "In recent years there has been a surge in applications focusing on streaming data to generate insights in real-time. Both academia, as well as industry, have tried to address this use case by developing a variety of Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) with a diverse feature set. On the other hand, Big Data applications have started to make use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) which possess superior memory, I/O, and networking resources compared to typical Big Data clusters. Recent studies evaluating the performance of SPEs have focused on commodity clusters. However, exhaustive studies need to be performed to profile individual stages of a stream processing pipeline and how best to optimize each of these stages to best leverage the resources provided by HPC clusters. To address this issue, we profile the performance of a big data streaming pipeline using Apache Flink as the SPE and Apache Kafka as the intermediate message queue. We break the streaming pipeline into two distinct phases and evaluate percentile latencies for two different networks, namely 40GbE and InfiniBand EDR (100Gbps), to determine if a typical streaming application is network intensive enough to benefit from a faster interconnect. Moreover, we explore whether the volume of input data stream has any effect on the latency characteristics of the streaming pipeline, and if so how does it compare for different stages in the streaming pipeline and different network interconnects. Our experiments show an increase of over 10x in 98 percentile latency when input stream volume is increased from 128MB/s to 256MB/s. Moreover, we find the intermediate stages of the stream pipeline to be a significant contributor to the overall latency of the system.",

The massive data can broadly be categorized into raw data and right data. Future generation network (5G) can be optimized if right data is extracted efficiently from such a massive raw data. Such a solution is provided through big data analytics. In this article, we discuss big data analytics solution for 5G network. We also outline existing big data architectures proposed for the network optimization. We propose a generalized flow structure for big data based analytics in 5G. Finally, we summarize our article by highlighting some challenges for big data analytics in 5G.",

Data coming from the IoT, from scientific simulations, or from any other field of the eScience, are accumulated over historical data sets and set up the seed for future Big Data processing, with the final goal to generate added value and discover knowledge. In such computing processes, data are the main resource; however, organizing and managing data during their entire life cycle becomes a complex research topic. As part of this, Data LifeCycle (DLC) models have been proposed to efficiently organize large and complex data sets, from creation to consumption, in any field, and any scale, for an effective data usage and big data exploitation.Several DLC frameworks can be found in the literature, each one defined for specific environments and scenarios. However, we realized that there is no global and comprehensive DLC model to be easily adapted to different scientific areas. For this reason, in this paper we describe the Comprehensive Scenario Agnostic Data LifeCycle (COSA-DLC) model, a DLC model which: i) is proved to be comprehensive as it addresses the 6Vs challenges (namely Value, Volume, Variety, Velocity, Variability and Veracity; and ii), it can be easily adapted to any particular scenario and, therefore, fit the requirements of a specific scientific field. In this paper we also include two use cases to illustrate the ease of the adaptation in different scenarios. We conclude that the comprehensive scenario agnostic DLC model provides several advantages, such as facilitating global data management, organization and integration, easing the adaptation to any kind of scenario, guaranteeing good data quality levels and, therefore, saving design time and efforts for the scientific and industrial communities.",

Similar data is now becoming widely available in other domains. Software systems that utilize such operational data (OD) to help with software design and maintenance activities are increasingly being built despite the difficulties of drawing valid conclusions from disparate and low-quality data and the continuing evolution of operational support tools. This paper proposes systematizing approaches to the engineering of OD-based systems. To prioritize and structure research areas we consider historic developments, such as big data hype; synthesize defining features of OD, such as confounded measures and unobserved context; and discuss emerging new applications, such as diverse and large OD collections and extremely short development intervals. To sustain the credibility of OD-based systems more research will be needed to investigate effective existing approaches and to synthesize novel, OD-specific engineering principles.",

Real-time big data streaming analytics is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a streaming big data architecture for real-time social network analysis. As a case study, we investigated the relation between the public opinions on social media about cryptocurrencies and the changes in their prices using lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches with the goal of assessing the feasibility of predicting the prices of cryptocurrencies. Two different approaches with two lexicons were used for sentiment analysis score calculations to assess the consistency of correlation measures on the collected dataset. Our model indicates that the prediction of cryptocurrency price changes using lexicon-based sentiment analysis methods is not reliable.",

A vast amount of big data already resides in the cloud, and cloud infrastructures provide a scalable platform for both the computational and I/O needs of big data processing applications. Virtualization is used as a base technology in the cloud; however, existing virtual machine placement techniques do not consider data replication and I/O bottlenecks of the infrastructure, yielding sub-optimal data retrieval times. This paper targets efficient big data processing in the cloud and proposes novel virtual machine placement techniques, which minimize data retrieval time by considering data replication, storage performance, and network bandwidth. We first present an integer-programming based optimal virtual machine placement algorithm and then propose two low cost data- and energy-aware virtual machine placement heuristics. Our proposed heuristics are compared with optimal and existing algorithms through extensive evaluation. Experimental results provide strong indications for the superiority of our proposed solutions in both performance and energy, and clearly outline the importance of big data aware virtual machine placement for efficient processing of large datasets in the cloud.",

                "abstract": "Technological evolution leads to increasingly large and heterogeneous data acquisitions (signals, images, measurement results, texts, etc.), and the growing share of information technology and digital simulation leads to the production of increasingly important quantities of data. This is the case for example in web mining, in biology with the sequencing of different genomes, in astronomy with the proliferation of images from probes or observatories, in meteorology with the simulation of atmospheric phenomena and their visualization, in environmental studies with earth observations, or also in social and human sciences with the digitization of corpus and dictionaries. In such contexts, the formalism of binned data is perfectly suited to deal with the massive data issues. This is particularly interesting in many industrial applications where conventional processing algorithms induce unreasonable computation times. In this talk, the importance and advantages of binning data, in big data clustering and classification, will be shown. Then, the fundamental and basic concepts of mixture models estimation from binned data will be presented. A special attention will be paid to the binned-EM algorithm and the bin-EM-CEM algorithm, and their application to data clustering and classification. A feedback on the implementation and use of these algorithms will be provided. In addition, some hard and open problems (data heterogeneity, new data structures and types, imprecision and variability of data, validation of the obtained partition structure, model selection, choice of the clusters number, etc.) and some promising solutions will be suggested. In order to show the usefulness of the presented approaches, some examples from real applications will be illustrated.",

However, many users still face the burden of complex framework knowledge requirement to efficiently deploy applications in the cloud. In this paper, we investigate serverless computing for performing large scale data processing with cloud-native primitives. Serverless computing environment abstracts all infrastructure handling, simplifying developers’ work who aspire to deploy applications on the cloud. With dynamic input load on the system, serverless architecture has promise to provide better resource utilization and lower costs.",

Advanced analysis of big data streams from sensors and devices is bound to become a key area of data mining research as the number of applications requiring such processing increases. Dealing with the evolution over time of such data streams, i.e., with concepts that drift or change completely, is one of the core issues in IoT stream mining. This tutorial is a gentle introduction to mining IoT big data streams. The first part introduces data stream learners for classification, regression, clustering, and frequent pattern mining. The second part deals with scalability issues inherent in IoT applications, and discusses how to mine data streams on distributed engines such as Spark, Flink, Storm, and Samza.",

When these events are concluded, the travel patterns of the returning international participants could further contribute to a rapid spread of infectious diseases causing global epidemics. The need to establish real-time disease outbreak surveillance at global mass gatherings motivates new technologies and advanced computational methods. The rapid expansion of digital devices and access to internet applications among participants in these gatherings generate a massive amount of data. Once being collected and processed, these data along with other health-related data can make significant contributions to improve disease surveillance systems at global mass gatherings. In this paper, we present an overview of the main existing approaches for monitoring outbreaks of infectious diseases in these events and illustrate the perspectives and opportunities of Big Data in these application areas.",

In this paper, we investigate the use of Apache Spark to store and process Variant Calling Files (VCF) on a Hadoop cluster. We demonstrate Tomatula, a software tool for converting VCF files to Apache Parquet storage format, and an application to query variant calling datasets. We evaluate how the wall time (i.e. time until the query answer is returned to the user) scales out on a Hadoop cluster storing VCF files, either in the original flat-file format, or using the Apache Parquet columnar storage format. Apache Parquet can compress the VCF data by around a factor of 10, and supports easier querying of VCF files as it exposes the field structure. We discuss advantages and disadvantages in terms of storage capacity and querying performance with both flat VCF files and Apache Parquet using an open plant breeding dataset. We conclude that Apache Parquet offers benefits for reducing storage size and wall time, and scales out with larger datasets.",

Analyzing such an increasing massive volume of data faces computational, as well as, statistical challenges. In order to solve these challenges, distributed and parallel processing frameworks have been used for implementing scalable data analysis algorithms. Nevertheless, processing the whole big data set at one time may exceed the available computing resources and the time requirements for some applications. Thus, approximate approaches can be used to achieve asymptotic analysis results, especially when data analysis algorithms are amenable to an approximate result rather than an exact one. However, most approximation approaches require taking a random sample of the data which is a nontrivial task when working with big data sets. In this paper, we employ ensemble learning as an approach for asymptotic analysis using randomly selected subsets (i.e. data blocks) of a big data set. We propose an asymptotic ensemble learning framework which depends on block-based sampling rather than record-based sampling. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of this framework, we present an empirical analysis on real data sets. In addition to the scalability advantage, the experimental results show that several blocks of a data set are enough to get approximately the same results as those from using the whole data set.",

Big data for security, i.e., the analysis of very large enterprise data sets to identify actionable security information and hence to improve enterprise security, however, is a relatively unexplored area. Enterprises routinely collect terabytes of security relevant data, e.g., network logs and application logs, for several reasons such as availability of cheap storage and need for regulatory compliance and post hoc forensic analysis. But we face a situation where more is less; the more data we collect, the less is our ability to derive actionable information from the data.Our research group is trying to move toward a scenario where more is more; we aim to design and implement algorithms and systems to identify security relevant information from large enterprise datasets. The more data we collect, the more value we derive from the data. Our approach opens up new opportunities by combining data from multiple sources in an enterprise and from multiple enterprises. We, however, face many challenges, e.g., legal, privacy, and technical issues regarding scalable data collection and storage and scalable analytics platforms for security.Our group is currently focusing on several big data problems. In this talk, we will briefly describe the problems and then focus on one example - scalable and reliable identification of infected hosts in an enterprise network and of malicious domains visited by the enterprise's hosts. We model the identification problem as an inference problem over very large graphs derived from enterprise datasets. We will describe our experience of applying the inference approach to datasets collected from multiple enterprises worldwide.",

First, we summarize the unique characteristics of the Big Data problem in the Department of Defense (DoD) context and underline the main differences from the commercial Big Data problems. Then, we introduce two use cases, (i) Big Data analytics with multi-intelligence (multi-INT) sensor data and (ii) man-machine crowdsourcing using MapReduce framework. For these two use cases, we introduce Big Data analytics and cloud computing solutions in a coherent frame- work that supports tactical data, application, and computing needs.",

To reduce said costs while decreasing time-to-market we advocate the usage of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), i.e., software engineering by means of models and their automated manipulation.

However, with the rapid growth in the number of films, users have vastly different needs for the quality of the movie. In addition, facing big data, the traditional stand-alone RS is incapable to meet the need of an accurate and prompt recommendation. Aiming at solving these challenges, in this paper, we first parallelize the collaborative filtering to improve the computational efficiency, then we propose a quality-aware big data based movie recommendation system.",

By definition, Malicious SIM Cards (MSCs) identification in this paper aims to identify SIM cards which are utilized by malicious purposes on specified terminals at scale (e.g., SIM modem pool or bulk SMS machine), and behave significantly different from normal SIM cards, especially towards e-commercial companies' marketing events, e.g., releases of coupons. The proposed MSC identification method is implemented as a label-function-based factor matrix framework. Particularly, a set of label functions is constructed from six dimensions via telecom big data analytics, including frequency of replacement, location, card type, Call Detail Records (CDRs), ID type, in-network-period in terms of SIM cards. Subsequently, MSC labels are provided to the identified SIM cards among the entire China Unicom SIM cards, which realize an effective way for large scale commercial use. Finally, selected features' distribution of MSCs identified and normal SIM cards are illustrated for comparison purposes.",

The proposed framework can be viewed as an alternative to classical approaches where the privacy of big data is ensured via security-inspired protocols that check several (protocol) layers in order to achieve the desired privacy. Unfortunately, this injects considerable computational overheads in the overall process, thus introducing relevant challenges to be considered. Our approach instead tries to recognize the \"pedigree\" of suitable summary data representatives computed on top of the target big data repositories, hence avoiding computational overheads due to protocol checking. We also provide a relevant realization of the framework above, the so-called Data-dRIven aggregate-PROvenance privacy-preserving big Multidimensional data (DRIPROM) framework, which specifically considers multidimensional data as the case of interest.",

However, the emerging trend of public misinformation due to the chunk of information available on the internet affects public opinion formation (POF) about universities. Therefore, narrowing down on the fallouts in POF can provide evidence for managerial and policy interventions. This paper explores five-layer POF and its application with big data in university public opinion monitoring and processing. It reveals that big data technology can be actively employed to safeguard the image of university public opinion formation, but this can be inhibited by the lack of commitment to integrating multiple stakeholders on a common platform, privacy, and security concerns. The paper recommends collaboration between universities and the government to increase momentum on big data with requisite actions for mutual benefits.",

Users are engaged in web searching and accessing different types of websites, such as social media, banking, etc. As a result, a large volume of data is being generated in every day. It is necessary to load this data for analysis purposes. However, memory space and transmission time are the most important factors of limited processing. In most cases, we only need to extract the important textual data from these vast raw datasets. In this work, we propose content-based compression (CBC) for textual data analysis on the basis of the Huffman Code. The data is pre-analyzed to find very high frequency words and then a shorter symbol is inserted to replace those words. This compression approach is performed in an effort to maintain the original format of the data so that, compressed data structure could be completely transparent to Hadoop platform. The algorithm is evaluated on a set of real world data sets (e.g. Amazon movie review, food review, etc.) and a 52.4% average data size reduction is obtained from the experiment. Though this gain may seem modest, this can be supplementary to all other compression optimization techniques. Furthermore, the proposed technique can be effectively applied for the big data optimization purpose.",

                "abstract": "Since the dawn of time, man has always tried to predict the future. Inserted in an environmental context, the knowledge of the variables that influenced his life allowed him to reap daily benefits and ultimately ensured his survival. Weather forecasts, bets on sports results, financial analysis, estimation of life span probabilities, to name just a few examples, are based on increasingly accurate estimates thanks to increasingly efficient statistical techniques and detection tools. Risk and uncertainty, however, although increasingly limited, represent an essential variable of any future event. The possibility of measuring and preventing (even if close to their occurrence) unlikely, but potentially catastrophic events, can determine extraordinary competitive advantages or even just guarantee the survival of a business or human existence. Unlikely events, but catastrophic, are the so-called \"black swans\" [1], and represent the nightmare of those who rely on the Gaussian approach, since, even if they fall into the tails of the bell, they represent a non-negligible threat. Studies on the black swan, especially after the events linked to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, have brought to light the so-called fractal approach that comes closest to the occurrence of most natural events. The analysis of big data, focused on the identification of the black swan, can follow different paths, in any case, the \"normal\" Gauss curve, as demonstrated, does not lend itself to this type of analysis, therefore most of the statistical tools which are based on this are not suitable for these analyses. This research highlights and tries to demonstrate how the fractal approach, combined with quantum technology, could really represent a great advance in the reliability of future predictions and the detection of black swans.",

The role big data plays in such design could be crucial, by providing access to otherwise elusive information on movements of people and goods in a city which can then transparently inform the design process, especially about possible demands and related complexities on the infrastructure being planned. To harness this data, it is necessary to formulate the problem technically such that data can inform experts, by articulating their expertise through the data. In this paper we present an application to analyze millions of instances of spatial data to identify potential locations for electrical road installation(s) in a city, to aid urban planners and other relevant stakeholders in planning and designing an Electrical Road System for a city. The dataset being used is gathered from a major vehicle manufacturer in Sweden, containing millions of instances of GPS data emitted by thousands of vehicles. A plan for electrified transport system is formulated by retrieving locations suitable for both static and dynamic charging installations. We investigate the technical formulation of methods and metrics for such a complex design problem, based on criteria set by experts, thus contributing to the science of big data for design of infrastructure and to methodology of data science in an institutional context.",

As rich and constant sources of big data, an incredible amount of people from different social stratum take part in social networks. Hence, social networks are desired for many research topics. In social networks, users (or social entities) are often linked by some 'following' relationships. As the social networks growing, some famous users account (or social entities) might be followed by a large number of same other users. In this situation, we call those famous users as frequently followed groups, which some researchers (or businesses) may be interested in them for investigating. However, the discovery of those frequently followed groups might be difficult and challenging because the following data in social networks are usually very big but sparse (huge number of users lead to big 'following' data, but each user is likely only following a small number of other users). As a result, in this paper, we present a new compression model, which can be used during mining these very big but sparse social networks for discovering the frequently followed groups of users/social entities.",

Typically, data is generated by commercial businesses or government organizations with no mandate and little motivation to share their assets with academic partners---partial exceptions include social messaging data and some sources of open data. The mobilization of citizen sensors at a massive scale has allowed for the development of impressive infrastructures. However, data availability is driving applications---problems are prioritized because data is available rather than because they are inherently important or interesting. The U.K. is addressing this through investments by the Economic and Social Research Council in its Big Data Network. A group of Administrative Data Research Centres are tasked with improving access to data sets in central government, while a group of Business and Local Government Centres are tasked with improving access to commercial and regional sources. This initiative is described. It is illustrated by examples from health care, transport, and infrastructure. In all of these cases, the integration of data is a key consideration. For social science problems relevant to policy or academic studies, it is unlikely all the answers will be found in a single novel data source, but rather a combination of sources is required. Through such synthesis great leaps are possible by exploiting models that have been constructed and refined over extended periods of time e.g., microsimulation, spatial interaction models, agents, discrete choice, and input-output models. Although interesting and valuable new methods are appearing, any suggestion that a new box of magic tricks labeled \"Big Data Analytics\" that sits easily on top of massive new datasets can radically and instantly transform our long-term understanding of society is naïve and dangerous. Furthermore, the privacy and confidentiality of personal data is a great concern to both the individuals concerned and the data owners.",

This data, mined for our behaviors, habits, likes and dislikes, is referred to as the \"creep factor\" of big data [1]. It is estimated that data generated worldwide will be 1.3 zettabytes (ZB) by 2016. The rise of computational power plus cheaper and faster devices to capture, collect, store and process data, translates into the \"datafication\" of society [4]. This paper will examine a side effect of datafication: discrimination.",

Meanwhile, the guiding and directing role of government in the field of big data application, especially the big data credit collection, is emphasized. The big data technology is well utilized to build big data collection, storage and processing platform based on the big data credit collection. In order to fundamentally solve the problem of financing difficulty in local small and medium-sized enterprise due to long-term data circulation and information asymmetry, a theoretical credit rating model is established and continuously optimized according to the features of textile and garment industry in this area. This report also contributes to the innovation-driven development of local textile and garment enterprises, promotes the management level of enterprises, and improves the innovation ability of business models.",

Since the value of data explodes when it can be linked and fused with other data, addressing the big data integration (BDI) challenge is critical to realizing the promise of Big Data.BDI differs from traditional data integration in many dimensions: (i) the number of data sources, even for a single domain, has grown to be in the tens of thousands, (ii) many of the data sources are very dynamic, as a huge amount of newly collected data are continuously made available, (iii) the data sources are extremely heterogeneous in their structure, with considerable variety even for substantially similar entities, and (iv) the data sources are of widely differing qualities, with significant differences in the coverage, accuracy and timeliness of data provided. This tutorial explores the progress that has been made by the data integration community on the topics of schema mapping, record linkage and data fusion in addressing these novel challenges faced by big data integration, and identifies a range of open problems for the community.",

But big data sets also amplify any system or software inefficiencies when large data sets require processing. So the efficiency of the generate code (and the runtime system) is crucial if we want to see widespread use of applications based on big data.Adaptive software exploits platform and data properties to custom-tailor program executions to the current environment. However, modern platforms have many features that make it difficult to support adaptive software. Multi-core systems with a non-uniform memory architecture expose various asymmetries and complicate the runtime system's task of data management, yet even modest multi-processors exhibit NUMA properties. Processor features like prefetchers are difficult to model by a compiler and may influence the execution in unexpected ways. Finally, performance monitoring units are supposed to allow a (just-in-time) compiler to obtain the information needed to adapt the generated code. But current performance monitoring units are incomplete and, worse, subject to change over time. An adaptive software system needs performance data that is readily available, reliable, and stable.In this talk I will discuss our experiences in modeling modern systems and argue for portable performance monitoring units that allow higher levels of the software tool chain to rely on live performance data.",

A vast amount of research work has been done in the multimedia area, targeting different aspects of big data analytics, such as the capture, storage, indexing, mining, and retrieval of multimedia big data. However, very few research work provides a complete survey of the whole pine-line of the multimedia big data analytics, including the management and analysis of the large amount of data, the challenges and opportunities, and the promising research directions. To serve this purpose, we present this survey, which conducts a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research work on multimedia big data analytics. It also aims to bridge the gap between multimedia challenges and big data solutions by providing the current big data frameworks, their applications in multimedia analyses, the strengths and limitations of the existing methods, and the potential future directions in multimedia big data analytics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that targets the most recent multimedia management techniques for very large-scale data and also provides the research studies and technologies advancing the multimedia analyses in this big data era.",
