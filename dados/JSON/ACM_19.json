The model developed first converts the financial time series data into a series of buy-sell-hold trigger signals using the most commonly preferred technical analysis indicators. Then, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained in the learning stage on the daily stock prices between 1997 and 2007 for all of the Dow30 stocks. Apache Spark big data framework is used in the training stage. The trained model is then tested with data from 2007 to 2017. The results indicate that by choosing the most appropriate technical indicators, the neural network model can achieve comparable results against the Buy and Hold strategy in most of the cases. Furthermore, fine tuning the technical indicators and/or optimization strategy can enhance the overall trading performance.",

In the actual combat, it is not only the rational use of tactics that affects the firefighters' fire fighting and rescue practical ability. More importantly, whether the firefighters' physical reserve and injury protection can support them to complete the rescue task in actual combat and how to scientifically manage the fire rescue team is the key to improve their combat ability. Aiming at this problem, this paper analyzes the impact of physical training and injury protection on the firefighters' fire fighting and rescue ability and puts forward the management scheme.",

Data practices are local, varying from field to field, individual to individual, and country to country. As the number and variety of research partners expands, so do the difficulties of sharing, reusing, and sustaining access to data. Information retrieval is hindered by the lack of agreement on what are \"data.\" Complexities of human interaction with data will be illustrated with empirical examples from environmental sciences, sensor networks, astronomy, biomedicine, and other fields. Unless larger questions of knowledge infrastructures and stewardship are addressed by research communities, \"no data\" often becomes the norm. Implications for policy and practice in the information sciences will be explored, drawing upon the presenter's book, Big Data, Little Data, No Data: Scholarship in the Networked World (MIT Press, 2015), and subsequent research.",

Therefore, users tend to give an excessive heap size to applications to avoid job failure, causing low cluster utilization.In this paper, we demonstrate that lightweight virtualization, such as OS containers, opens up opportunities to address memory pressure: 1) tasks running in a container can be set to a large heap size to avoid OOM errors without worrying about thrashing the host machine; 2) tasks that are under memory pressure and incur significant GC activities can be temporarily \"suspended\" by depriving the hosting container's resources, and can be \"resumed\" later when other tasks complete and release their resources. We propose and develop mBalloon, an elastic memory manager, that leverages containers to flexibly and precisely control the memory usage of big data tasks. Applications running with mBalloon can survive from memory pressure, incur less GC overhead and help improve cluster utilization.",

The basic idea is to treat the bottleneck identification problem as a variable importance analysis problem from a large volume of performance data which is generated by collecting the time costs under different combinations of algorithm level parameters. Based on the performance data set, random forest is adopted to conduct the variable importance ranking task. We also note an important fact that there might no performance bottleneck exists in the scope of the whole rendering system, but it is likely that bottlenecks could be found under some specific conditions. Thus we propose a bottleneck analysis tree to split the parameter space into many subspaces in which performance bottlenecks can be identified.",

Big data has affected capital, technology, talent flow, etc., changed people's production and life, and also had a huge impact on the field of education, especially HE (Higher Education). In the education industry, information technology not only affects the educational means and technology, but also forms a new motive force and new idea for the development of education. Scientific and rational application of educational big data, optimization of educational management and teaching decision-making, and improvement of educational and teaching effects are important contents of information-based teaching reform and innovation, which can promote educational management and decision-making, and enhance the scientific level of educational management and teaching decision-making. This paper analyzes the positive and negative impacts of big data on HE management, studies the main causes of various problems, and puts forward ways to optimize HE management and decision-making based on cloud computing technology under the background of big data.",

Rather than tackle the problem of evaluating large educational units such as entire online courses, this paper approaches a smaller problem: exploring a framework for evaluating more granular educational units, in this case, short educational videos. We have chosen to leverage an adaptation of traditional Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), intended to incorporate the usage of video content in addition to assessment activity. By exploring the change in predictive error when alternately including or omitting video activity, we suggest a metric for determining the relevance of videos to associated assessments. To validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the application of our proposed methods we use data obtained from the popular Khan Academy website.",

This data at present is very large in volume running to the order of terabytes. With the increasing adoption of digitized patient records and physician's notes, it has the potential of reaching peta (1015) or even exa (1018) bytes of data which in itself will be difficult to manage and analyze. Further, much of this data is in separate silos, which prevents it from being correlated and analyzed. However, very few providers can afford the infrastructure; both hardware and software are needed to collect, clean, curate, and analyze this data. As such, cloud-based healthcare services provide an important technique with which to make analytics driven personalized medicine services available to practitioners at the point of care. This however raises serious concerns around patient privacy, and also issues of regulatory compliance, as the data would reside with the cloud provider and outside of the confines of the physician's control.",

This method has become popular in studies involving smartphones, where it is often adapted to motivate participation through the use of gamification techniques. However, no work to date has evaluated whether gamification actually affects the quality and quantity of data collected through Experience Sampling. Our study systematically investigates the effect of gamification on the quantity and quality of experience sampling responses on smartphones. In a field study, we combine event contingent and interval contingent triggers to ask participants to describe their location. Subsequently, participants rate the quality of these entries by playing a game with a purpose. Our results indicate that participants using the gamified version of our ESM software provided significantly higher quality responses, slightly increased their response rate, and provided significantly more data on their own accord. Our findings suggest that gamifying experience sampling can improve data collection and quality in mobile settings.",

This study was undertaken as part of the Quality Education Fund project in Hong Kong, titled \"Flipped Reading: Enhancing the Learning and Teaching of Reading Strategies and Comprehension in Chinese via an Interactive Cloud Platform.\"This paper presents the design of the Interactive Cloud Platform FRP, which incorporates elements of both reading strategies and learning activities, and investigates the changes in students' reading performance, applied strategies, and active learning level with the application of FRP. The results show the experimental students using the FRP in the pilot scheme generally gained more in three stages of reading comprehension, and that low-achieving students learned reading strategies better. Analysis of FRP log activities shows students' active engagement in reading and perceived competence. Different learning outcomes were also found within the experimental group, categorized by BYOD and non-BYOD classes. Implications of the study show the effectiveness of FRP, and the design demonstrates how the reading measures integrated the assessment indicators of both international and local standards in the domain of Chinese Language reading. Further research can be developed to examine individual online reading performance and learning behaviour on FRP.",

To help in meeting this challenge, we present the Neutral Online Visualization-aided Autonomic evaluation framework (NOVA) for evaluating machine learning and data mining algorithms for preventive maintenance on the electrical grid. NOVA has three stages provided through a unified user interface: evaluation of input data quality, evaluation of machine learning and data mining results, and evaluation of the reliability improvement of the power grid. A prototype version of NOVA has been deployed for the power grid in New York City, and it is able to evaluate machine learning and data mining systems effectively and efficiently.",

By its size, its adaptability and flexibility, it challenged our current paradigms on information sharing in several areas. By offering everybody the opportunity to release own contents in a fast and cheap way, the Web already led to a revolution of the traditional publishing world and just now, it commences to change the perspective on advertisements. With the possibility to adapt the contents displayed on a page dynamically based on the viewer's context, campaigns launched to target rough customer groups will become an element of the past. However, this new ecosystem, that relates advertisements with the user, heavily relies on the quality of the underlying user profile. This profile has to be able to model any combination of user characteristics, the relations between its composing elements and the uncertainty that stems from the automated processing of real-world data. The work at hand describes the beginnings of a PhD project that aims to tackle those issues using a combination of data analysis, ontology engineering and processing of big data resources provided by an industrial partner. The final goal is to automatically construct and populate a profile ontology for each user identified by the system. This allows to associate these users to high-value audience segments in order to drive digital marketing.",

It enables the researchers to deploy massive accelerators within one single chip. In this paper, we present a software defined FPGA based accelerators for big data, named SODA, which could reconstruct and reorganize the acceleration engines according to the requirement of the various data-intensive applications. SODA decomposes large and complex applications into coarse grained single-purpose RTL code libraries that perform specialized tasks in out-of-order hardware. We built a prototyping system with constrained shortest path Finding (CSPF) case studies to evaluate SODA framework. SODA is able to achieve up to 43.75X speedup at 128 node application. Furthermore, hardware cost of the SODA framework demonstrates that it can achieve high speedup with moderate hardware utilization.",

                "abstract": "There is a tremendous interest in big data by academia, industry and a large user base. Several commercial and open source providers unleashed a variety of products to support big data storage and processing. As these products mature, there is a need to evaluate and compare the performance of these systems.In this paper, we present BigBench, an end-to-end big data benchmark proposal. The underlying business model of BigBench is a product retailer. The proposal covers a data model and synthetic data generator that addresses the variety, velocity and volume aspects of big data systems containing structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. The structured part of the BigBench data model is adopted from the TPC-DS benchmark, which is enriched with semi-structured and unstructured data components. The semi-structured part captures registered and guest user clicks on the retailer's website. The unstructured data captures product reviews submitted online. The data generator designed for BigBench provides scalable volumes of raw data based on a scale factor. The BigBench workload is designed around a set of queries against the data model. From a business prospective, the queries cover the different categories of big data analytics proposed by McKinsey. From a technical prospective, the queries are designed to span three different dimensions based on data sources, query processing types and analytic techniques.We illustrate the feasibility of BigBench by implementing it on the Teradata Aster Database. The test includes generating and loading a 200 Gigabyte BigBench data set and testing the workload by executing the BigBench queries (written using Teradata Aster SQL-MR) and reporting their response times.",

We focus on two phases of analysts' work: discovery, where the field definitions are understood, and profiling, where assumptions are tested by searching, observing, and running counts on data. Lack of data exploration and understanding can lead to faulty assumptions and misinterpretation. In practice, analysts use SQL queries and scripts to subset big data, reducing it for visualization or spreadsheet pivots. However, due to large-size and high-dimensional data, it is challenging to determine precise subsets of interest without thorough data exploration and discovery. We reduce the cost of previewing subsets by combining search with an information rich visualization of high-dimensional data. To enable discovery and profiling, Quarry supports (1) rapid query generation and visualized search; and (2) defining and previewing subsets of data for potential export for further processing. This work presents the design of Quarry and results from a formative study involving 11 analysts/data scientists and a dataset with 80 columns and 15 million rows.",

More and more threats across the Internet has evolved and capable to deceive firewall as well as antivirus software. In addition, the number of attacks become larger and become more dificult to be processed by the firewall or antivirus software. To improve the security of the system is usually done by adding Intrusion Detection System(IDS), which divided into anomaly-based detection and signature-based detection. In this research to process a huge amount of data, Big Data technique is used. Anomaly-based detection is proposed using Learning Vector Quantization Algorithm to detect the attacks. Learning Vector Quantization is a neural network technique that learn the input itself and then give the appropriate output according to the input. Modifications were made to improve test accuracy by varying the test parameters that present in LVQ. Varying the learning rate, epoch and k-fold cross validation resulted in a more efficient output. The output is obtained by calculating the value of information retrieval from the confusion matrix table from each attack classes. Principal Component Analysis technique is used along with Learning Vector Quantization to improve system performance by reducing the data dimensionality. By using 18-Principal Component, dataset successfully reduced by 47.3%, with the best Recognition Rate of 96.52% and time efficiency improvement up to 43.16%.",

In order to realize the classification of the terrain environment where the robot is located, this paper uses the gradient boosting tree LightGBM to identify and classify the IMU signals of the robot feet. First of all, the quaternion Euler transform and segmentation are performed on the signal. Secondly, the different period segments of the signal are analyzed and feature fused from the time domain and frequency domain respectively. Finally, the decision tree integrated hybrid classifier with the best parameters, namely LightGBM, is employed to classify the robot on the ground. The experimental results show that the accuracy of this method for the recognition of robot IMU signals on different surfaces reaches 90.7%.",

Therefore, the combination of data mining algorithms and IoT technology is the development trend of data processing in the future, but because of the difficulty, not all algorithms can be implemented on the cloud platform, so the research results are not enough. The core idea of cloud computing is architecture. All data mining algorithm improvement strategies need to be designed according to the characteristics of the architecture, and each part must implement specific functions. It is difficult or impossible to implement an algorithm that cannot be decomposed into the above form in the architecture. With the widespread application of IoT technology, a large number of unstructured, distributed and even data mining requirements in mobile devices pose serious challenges to existing data mining technologies. How to use cloud computing technology to achieve large-scale distributed data collection, transmission and mining has become an important research direction. This paper investigates some health care big data, combines the Internet of Things cloud data platform, and introduces the traditional association rules algorithm and its interest level in mining technology. On this basis, the improved algorithm is improved and compared with other traditional algorithms. Establish a simulation platform to implement algorithms and mine training data. It proves that the improved algorithm has lower spatial complexity and faster processing rate in data mining, and analyzes the data mining technology in health medical data.",

Among them, improving students' music literacy is a very effective way. At present, the application of computers and big data (BD) algorithms is becoming more and more common, and a large amount of data has been accumulated. Applying data mining technology to the analysis of music teaching data in higher VC can help teachers understand the music quality of students and improve students' music quality in a targeted manner. The purpose of this article is to analyze the optimization path of music education in higher VC under the background of BD. This paper uses path analysis BD algorithm to optimize and analyze the music education data of higher VC, analyzes the related concepts and internal and external structural elements of the music education system in higher VC, and elaborates the composition of the music education path in higher VC. The internal and external structure of the elements, the path and the operation mechanism of the path are solved by programming using GAMS software, and all the best feasible solutions are solved through the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) BD algorithm, and the optimization path related to music education in VC is studied. The path analysis experiment shows that when higher VC fully develop music teaching activities, the main source of music education promotion in higher VC is the conversion of internal and external integrated pathways and internal model pathways, which account for more than 80%, while the external model pathway accounts for more than 80% The allocation is relatively small, less than 10%.",

Project EPIC has been designing and developing data-intensive systems in support of crisis informatics research since Fall 2009. Our experience working on Project EPIC has provided insight into these challenges. In this paper, we share our experience working in this design space and describe the choices we made in tackling these challenges and their attendant trade-offs. We highlight the lack of developer support tools for data-intensive systems, the importance of multidisciplinary teams, the use of highly-iterative life cycles, the need for deep understanding of the frameworks and technologies used in data intensive systems, how simple operations transform into significant challenges at scale, and the paramount significance of data modeling in producing systems that are scalable, robust, and efficient.",

Because music itself is complex and difficult to quantify, how to judge the influence of music has become a difficult task. Based on big data technology, this paper constructs a music directional network, builds a comprehensive evaluation model based on intergenerational transmission and weight design reduction, measures the influence of each music genre and other genres, and visualizes it. In addition, we constructed a mathematical model based on the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the similarity between songs and between musicians and genres. Finally, we also analyzed and evaluated the attributes of the artist through the radar chart. We hope that through this experiment, we can contribute to the study of music influence and the division of music genres.",

                "abstract": "Currently, vehicle traffic is one of the major problems in Mexico City. Two factors which contribute to this problem are the government transport policies and the disproportionate growth in the number of automobiles. In this paper, we propose a system called Trafico CDMX which analyzes historical data from three geosocial networks Waze, TomTom and Nokia Here to define proper government transport policies to improve the mobility in Mexico City. This system can also identify the major conflict zones where traffic and accidents occur frequently. Trafico CDMX defines a set of web services classified in one of three kinds, visualization, prediction (of speed or number of incidents reports), and chronological animation of accidents or traffic in one or two days (for comparisons). The services provided by this system can be used for other systems, and it can be easily extended to other cities.",

The rate at which we produce data is growing steadily, thus creating larger and larger streams of continuously evolving data. Online news, micro-blogs, search queries are just a few examples of these continuous streams of user activities. The value of these streams relies in their freshness and relatedness to ongoing events. However, current (de-facto standard) solutions for big data analysis are not designed to deal with evolving streams.In this talk, we offer a sneak preview of SAMOA, an upcoming platform for mining dig data streams. SAMOA is a platform for online mining in a cluster/cloud environment. It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on several distributed stream processing engines such as S4 and Storm. SAMOA includes algorithms for the most common machine learning tasks such as classification and clustering. Finally, SAMOA will soon be open sourced in order to foster collaboration and research on big data stream mining.",

Clustering methods are especially important for big data applications where the dimensionality is high and the amount of data is too large to be examined by human. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the start-of-the-art clustering methods and their recent progresses, and analyzes their performances when applied to a high-dimensional expression level dataset across multiple environments. As PCA and MDS are very commonly used among researchers for clustering environments based on expression level, we show that UMAP and t-SNE greatly outperforms these traditional methods. The conclusion of the paper will be able to assist researchers to understand how the clustering methods works and pick up the best method for related proposes; and hopefully, by combining the ideas and advantages of multiple clustering methods, novel clustering methods that are more powerful and universal can be developed.",

The research on improving the effectiveness of college students' ideology education in the era of big data not only determines the security of university ideology, but also is closely linked with the thinking orientation of college students. The mode of combining computer network with education and teaching is a representative modern teaching mode. The teaching mode takes computer as teaching aid and network as one of the main ways of knowledge dissemination. Based on the big data analysis method, this paper constructs an auxiliary teaching system which can be specially used for the study and communication of university ideology courses. With a view to effectively improving students' learning experience and learning initiative.",

This paper reports on the in-progress development of a new middle school curricular module for Big Data, situated as part of a new CS Principles-based middle school curriculum. Big Data is of widespread societal importance and holds increasing implications for the computer science workforce. It also has appeal as a focus for middle school computer science because of its rich interplay with other important computer science principles. This paper examines three key aspects of a Big Data unit for middle school: its alignment with emerging curricular standards; the perspectives of middle school classroom teachers in mathematics, science, and language arts; and student feedback as explored during a middle school pilot study with a small subset of the planned curriculum. The results indicate that a Big Data unit holds great promise as part of a middle school computer science curriculum.",

Useful and cost-effective analysis of this data is the biggest economic driver for the IT industry. Such analyses are often done in data centers or on cluster of machines because they involve applying sophisticated algorithms to terabyte-size graphs, which are extremely irregular and sparse. We will show how low-power appliances for such analyses can be built using flash storage and hardware accelerators. Such appliances are likely to be 10X cheaper than 16-32 node server clusters and will come in the form factor of an SSD to be plugged into your laptop.This work has been done by Sang-Woo Jun and Andy Wright under my supervision",

By using these insights, companies can make better decisions and thus achieve their business goals. However, each new technology can create new security problems, and Big Data is no exception. One of the major security issues in a Big Data ecosystem is what level of trust in data and data sources stakeholders can have: without reliable data, the results of data analysis lose value. In this paper, we propose a security pattern to improve traceability and veracity of data through the use of Blockchain technologies. In this pattern, Blockchain will be used as a distributed ledger where all operations performed on the data will be registered. Therefore, the veracity of the data will increase, as will the confidence in the insights obtained from the analysis. The purpose of this paper is to help Chief Security Officer and Big Data architects incorporate this mechanism to improve the security of their environment.",

With the abundance of data information and increased data openness, various fields have been affected by BD. With the rapid growth of the Internet and new media, ethnic dance has inevitably entered the \"BD era\" as a manifestation of traditional culture. Way, folk dance has always played an important role, and its unique performance and ethnic style stimulate people's senses to give it artistic charm. Due to the continuous acceleration of the overall reform process in our country, national dances are also faced with the task of how to advance with the times, and scientific training is a breakthrough in this issue. This article aims to study the application of BD research methods in the field of national dance scientific training. This article uses case study methods, literature research methods, survey methods, mathematical statistical analysis methods, etc. to explore how BD can provide scientific training methods for ethnic dance, and combine the research results of previous experts or scholars to further explore ethnic dance under BD thinking. The scientific training path forms a relatively comprehensive understanding. Then through the sorting and analysis of various national dance technique materials, combining with practice and theory, put forward the content of scientific training, and then summarize the solutions to the difficulties faced by national dance training under the BD thinking. Experiments show that there are not many folk dance educators who know BD well, only 27%, but most teachers and students still have a certain understanding of BD, and believe that BD can make folk dance training methods more scientific or It has an auxiliary effect on the training methods of national dance.",

New computing frameworks and platforms are being proposed to review and analyze the data in detail. The application of these approaches in a low resource setting is challenged by the approaches used for data acquisition. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a form of cloud computing where a cloud-based software application enables the storage, analysis and visualization of data within the cloud. A subset of SaaS is Health Analytics as a Service (HAaaS), which provides software to support health analytics in the cloud. The objective of this study is to design, implement, and demonstrate an extendable big-data compatible HAaaS framework that offers both real-time and retrospective analysis where data acquisition is not tightly coupled. A data warehousing framework is presented to facilitate analysis within a low resource setting. The framework has been instantiated in the Artemis platform within the context of the Belgaum Children Hospital (BCH) case study. Initial end-to-end testing with the Nellcor monitor (bedside monitor at BCH), which was not connected to any human, was completed. This testing confirms the functionality of the new Artemis cloud instance to receive data from test device using an alternate data acquisition approach.",

Among them, \"flipped classroom\", an innovative teaching model that combines computer networks and teaching, has to be amazing. Judging from the schools that have tried this teaching model, the positive effect of this model is still very obvious. Not only does it increase the enthusiasm of students in class, gain more knowledge and apply the learned knowledge to life according to the situation, but also allows more interaction between teachers and students throughout the teaching process, and the teaching effect is more significant. This article takes the middle school physics teaching as the object, analyzes the problems in the teaching process, and uses the contrast method to compare the traditional teaching mode with the flipped classroom teaching mode. Analyze the characteristics of the latter in the teaching process, the problems in the operation process, and the feasibility of using this mode in middle school physics. It is hoped that through the analysis and research of the flipped classroom teaching model, the school can strengthen the emphasis on this model in the physics teaching process. And have a deeper understanding of this model to promote its further development.",

This huge bubble of data is a gold mine: it is an unlimited source of knowledge and insights about habits and preferences of people and has captured the attention of modern enterprises. Companies look at this data with interest and purpose to gain competitive advantage by applying analytics tools over them. In this context, a new approach is required for mastering data without the risk of ending up in the bubble and collecting a huge meaningless pile of junk data.

This century, it is about mining vast data sets of past user behaviors, simple algorithms, and using those to correct mistakes. The large Internet giants are data-driven enterprises that use data to transform and continually improve user experiences. In this talk, Hugh Williams shares stories about data and how it is used to build Internet products, and explains why he believes data will transform businesses as we know them. Every major company is becoming a data-driven company, and Hugh shares examples of transformations occurring in health, aviation, farming, and telecommunications. He recently joined Pivotal, a company that is assembling the toolkit that exists in only a few consumer Internet companies, and making that toolkit open and available to every industry, including big data platforms, development frameworks, and an open, cloud-independent Platform-as-a-Service. He will conclude by sharing details about Pivotal, the Pivotal vision, and roadmap.Hugh E. Williams has been Senior Vice President of Research & Development at Pivotal since January 2014. His teams build big data technologies, and development frameworks and services, including Pivotal's Hadoop, Spring Java framework, and Greenplum database offerings. Most recently, he spent four and a half years as an executive with eBay where he was responsible for the team that conceived, designed, and built eBay's user experiences, search engine, big data technologies and platforms. Prior to joining eBay, he managed an R&D team at Microsoft's Bing for four and a half years, spent over ten years researching and developing search technologies, and ran his own startup and consultancy for several years. He has published over 100 works, mostly in the field of Information Retrieval, including two books for O'Reilly Media Inc. He holds 19 U.S. patents, with many more pending. He has a PhD from RMIT University in Australia.",

Recently, venue recommendation is becoming an increasingly important research task due to the unprecedented number of publication venues. However, traditional methods focus on either the author’s local network or author-venue similarity, where the multiple relationships between scholars and venues are overlooked, especially the venue–venue interaction. To solve this problem, we propose an author topic model–enhanced joint graph modeling approach that consists of venue topic modeling, venue-specific topic influence modeling, and scholar preference modeling. We first model the venue topic with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Then, we model the venue-specific topic influence in an asymmetric and low-dimensional way by considering the topic similarity between venues, the top-influence of venues, and the top-susceptibility of venues. The top-influence characterizes venues’ capacity of exerting topic influence on other venues. The top-susceptibility captures venues’ propensity of being topically influenced by other venues. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our proposed joint graph modeling approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

                "abstract": "As more and more cyber security incident data ranging from systems logs to vulnerability scan results are collected, manually analyzing these collected data to detect important cyber security events become impossible. Hence, data mining techniques are becoming an essential tool for real-world cyber security applications. For example, a report from Gartner [gartner12] claims that \"Information security is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts of data will be correlated, analyzed and mined for meaningful patterns\". Of course, data mining/analytics is a means to an end where the ultimate goal is to provide cyber security analysts with prioritized actionable insights derived from big data. This raises the question, can we directly apply existing techniques to cyber security applications? One of the most important differences between data mining for cyber security and many other data mining applications is the existence of malicious adversaries that continuously adapt their behavior to hide their actions and to make the data mining models ineffective. Unfortunately, traditional data mining techniques are insufficient to handle such adversarial problems directly. The adversaries adapt to the data miner's reactions, and data mining algorithms constructed based on a training dataset degrades quickly. To address these concerns, over the last couple of years new and novel data mining techniques which is more resilient to such adversarial behavior are being developed in machine learning and data mining community. We believe that lessons learned as a part of this research direction would be beneficial for cyber security researchers who are increasingly applying machine learning and data mining techniques in practice.To give an overview of recent developments in adversarial data mining, in this three hour long tutorial, we introduce the foundations, the techniques, and the applications of adversarial data mining to cyber security applications. We first introduce various approaches proposed in the past to defend against active adversaries, such as a minimax approach to minimize the worst case error through a zero-sum game. We then discuss a game theoretic framework to model the sequential actions of the adversary and the data miner, while both parties try to maximize their utilities. We also introduce a modified support vector machine method and a relevance vector machine method to defend against active adversaries. Intrusion detection and malware detection are two important application areas for adversarial data mining models that will be discussed in details during the tutorial. Finally, we discuss some practical guidelines on how to use adversarial data mining ideas in generic cyber security applications and how to leverage existing big data management tools for building data mining algorithms for cyber security.",

Due to increasing data in volume, it needs performance optimization mechanism that requires management of JVM heap space. To Manage JVM heap space it needs management of garbage collector pause time that affects application performance. There are different parameters to pass to spark to control JVM heap space and GC time overhead to increase application performance. Passing appropriate heap size with appropriate types of GC as a parameter is one of performance optimization which is known as Spark Garbage collection tuning. To reduce GC overhead, an experiment was done by adjusting certain parameters for loading and dataframe creation and data retrieval process. The result shows 3.23% improvement in Latency and 1.62% improvement in Throughput as compared to default parameter configuration in garbage collection tuning approach.",

Through the questionnaire survey and interview in colleges and universities, this paper points out that the MH education of college students is still bound by experiential intuitive inertia thinking, unable to meet the needs, homogenized content, and unidirectional defects. There are technical means can not support, as well as the lack of educator personality and the lack of educatee personality. The questionnaire was distributed to 1200 college students by secret sampling, and 1150 questionnaires were effectively recovered, and the recovery rate was nearly 95. As a new symbol of the information age, there is no doubt that the huge economic and social value contained in the massive data, the transformation of the era opened by BD(BD), and the fact that it caused the change can not be avoided. BD is not only a technology, but also a value and methodology. It has brought methodological changes to college students' MH education, and also provides a possibility to improve their working methods, methods and means. The significance of individualized MH education for college students in the era of BD is to scientifically judge the MH state and behavior characteristics of students through the integration, mining and analysis of massive data, so as to formulate and adopt targeted MH education means and methods according to the students' individual reality. Through the analysis of the application cases of BD in MH education of college students, it is necessary and feasible to promote individualized MH education of college students by using BD.",

This research is based on current scholars' theoretical foundation and practical application research on education big data and the integration of intra- and extra-curricular models, and constructs a framework of intra- and extra-curricular integration based on the big data environment. Combining the characteristics of university physical education and students' learning characteristics, we construct an integrated teaching model in and out of class under the big data environment to guide the integrated teaching practice in and out of class. Through experiments and empirical demonstrations conducted by the \"in-class and extra-curricular integration\" teaching model, the teaching effect shows that the college physical education model has a positive effect in improving students' interest in learning, improving learning effects, and cultivating students' college sports habits. Extracurricular sports clubs better match the teaching content in class, so that the teaching content is well supplemented. The organic connection between the two is more conducive to the improvement of students' skill level. At the same time, this also promotes the development of campus culture and community culture.",

It provides methods and tools to extract aggregates and new information out of heterogeneously structured data or even completely unstructured data. Deep learning is a collection of algorithms that allows us to discover correlations and learn --- supervised and unsupervised --- from information provided. This contribution introduces the main ideas and methods of big data and deep learning and shows how they can be applied to various phases of the traditional modeling and simulation process. Big data supports obtaining data for the initialization as well as evaluating the results of the simulation experiment. Deep learning can help with the conceptual modeling phase as well as with the discovery of correlations in the results. Examples of existing applications will be given to prove the feasibility of such ideas. This leads to the observation that big data, deep learning, and modeling and simulation have the potential to lead to a new generation of modeling and simulation applications that provide computational scientific support on a new scale beyond the current capabilities.",

In this paper, we enrich a large retailer dataset with nutritional information extracted from crowd-sourced and administrative nutritional datasets. To compensate for imperfect matching through the barcode, we develop a methodology to efficiently match short textual descriptions. After a preprocessing step to normalize short labels, we resort to fuzzy matching based on several tokenizers (including n-grams) by querying an ElasticSearch customized index and validate candidates echos as matches with a Levensthein edit-distance and an embedding-based similarity measure created from a siamese neural network model. The pipeline is composed of several steps successively relaxing constraints to find relevant matching candidates.",

GeoSensor combines these two orthogonal operations through state-of-the-art Semantic Web technologies. At its core lies the open-source, semantics-enabled Big Data infrastructure developed by the EU H2020 BigDataEurope project. This allows GeoSensor to offer an on-line functionality, despite facing three major challenges of Big Data: Volume (a single satellite image typically occupies a few GBs), Variety (its data sources include two different types of satellite images and various types of user-generated content) and Veracity, as the accuracy of the end result is crucial for the usefulness of our system. We present GeoSensor's architecture in detail, highlighting the advantages of using semantics for taking the most of the knowledge extracted from news items and Earth Observation products. We also verify GeoSensor's efficiency through a preliminary experimental study.",
