                "abstract": "Object serialization and deserialization (S/D) is an essential feature for efficient communication between distributed computing nodes with potentially non-uniform execution environments. S/D operations are widely used in big data analytics frameworks for remote procedure calls and massive data transfers like shuffles. However, frequent S/D operations incur significant performance and energy overheads as they must traverse and process a large object graph. Prior approaches improve S/D throughput by effectively hiding disk or network I/O latency with computation, increasing compression ratio, and/or application-specific customization. However, inherent dependencies in the existing (de)serialization formats and algorithms eventually become the major performance bottleneck. Thus, we propose Cereal, a specialized hardware accelerator for memory object serialization. By co-designing the serialization format with hardware architecture, Cereal effectively utilizes abundant parallelism in the S/D process to deliver high throughput. Cereal also employs an efficient object packing scheme to compress metadata such as object reference offsets and a space-efficient bitmap representation for the object layout. Our evaluation of Cereal using both a cycle-level simulator and synthesizable Chisel RTL demonstrates that Cereal delivers 43.4x higher average S/D throughput than 88 other S/D libraries on Java Serialization Benchmark Suite. For six Spark applications Cereal achieves 7.97x and 4.81x speedups on average for S/D operations over Java built-in serializer and Kryo, respectively, while saving S/D energy by 227.75x and 136.28x.",

As data-driven decision making becomes prevalent, there is an increasing need for new measures for evaluating the quality of data systems. In this article, we make the case for social-minded measures, that is, measures that evaluate the effect of a system in society. We focus on three such measures, namely diversity (ensuring that all relevant aspects are represented), lack of bias (processing data without unjustifiable concentration on a particular side), and fairness (non discriminating treatment of data and people).",

In this paper, we report a novel and interesting case study of urban traffic prediction in Central, Hong Kong, one of the densest urban areas in the world. The novelty of our study is that we make good second use of inexpensive big data collected from the Hong Kong International Commerce Centre (ICC), a 118-story building in Hong Kong where more than 10,000 people work. As building environment data are much cheaper to obtain than traffic data, we demonstrate that it is highly effective to estimate building occupancy information using building environment data, and then to further use the information on occupancy to provide traffic predictions in the proximate area. Scientifically, we investigate how and to what extent building data can complement traffic data in predicting traffic. In general, this study sheds new light on the development of accurate data mining applications through the second use of inexpensive big data.",

In 2014, one of the tasks was to interpret routine and anomalous patterns of human mobility based on big data: trajectories of cars and credit card transactions.We describe a scalable visual analytics approach to solving this problem. Repeatedly visited personal and public places were extracted from trajectories by finding spatial clusters of stop points. Temporal patterns of people's presence in the places resulted from spatio-temporal aggregation of the data by the places and hourly intervals within the weekly cycle. Based on these patterns, we identified the meanings or purposes of the places: home, work, breakfast, lunch and dinner, etc. Meanings of some places could be refined using the credit card transaction data. By representing the place meanings as points on a 2D plane, we built an abstract semantic space and transformed the original trajectories to trajectories in the semantic space, i.e., performed semantic abstraction of the data. Spatio-temporal aggregation of the transformed trajectories into flows between the semantic places and subsequent clustering of time intervals by the similarity of the flow situations allowed us to reveal and analyze the routine movement behaviors. To detect anomalies, we (a) investigated the visits to the places with unknown meanings, and (b) looked for unusual presence times or visit durations at different semantic places.The analysis is scalable since all tools and methods can be applied to much larger data. Moreover, the semantic data abstraction can serve as a tool for protecting the personal privacy.",

Governments, enterprises, and the public are increasingly finding that the increasing deviation between the actual fuel consumption and the results of the regulatory certification based on NEDC (New European Driving Cycle). In addition, this deviation has seriously affected the credibility of the government, energy saving and emission reduction of automobiles and environmental pollution. Thus, need to improve urban driving cycle construction methods to adapt the Chinese traffic and automobiles driving cycles.This paper proposes an advanced data science model based on big data analysis for accurate urban driving cycle construction in Chinese cities. In addition, we conduct a lot of data analysis and statistics. Then we design a data preprocessing method for cleaning the noise data to use in driving cycle construction. Extensive experiments and analysis on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly reduce the impact of missing and abnormal data on microtrips segmentation, and thus the proposed methods can be used for driving cycle construction in China more accurately.",

                "abstract": "Numerous databases promoted as SQL-on-Hadoop, NewSQL and NoSQL support semi-structured, schemaless and heterogeneous data, typically in the form of enriched JSON. They also provide corresponding query languages. In addition to these genuine JSON databases, relational databases also provide special functions and language features for the support of JSON columns, typically piggybacking on non-1NF (non first normal form) features that SQL acquired over the years. We refer to SQL databases with JSON support as SQL/JSON databases.The evolving query languages present multiple variations: Some are superficial syntactic ones, while other ones are genuine differences in modeling, language capabilities and semantics. Incompatibility with SQL presents a learning challenge for genuine JSON databases, while the table orientation of SQL/JSON databases often leads to cumbersome syntactic/semantic structures that are contrary to the semistructured nature of JSON. Furthermore, the query languages often fall short of full-fledged semistructured query language capabilities, when compared to the yardstick set by XQuery and prior works on semistructured data (even after superficial model differences are abstracted out).We survey features, the designers' options and differences in the approaches taken by actual systems. In particular, we first present a SQL backwards-compatible language, named SQL++, which can access both SQL and JSON data. SQL++ is expected to be supported by Couchbase's CouchDB and UCI's AsterixDB semistructured databases. Then we expand SQL++ into the Configurable SQL++, whereas multiple possible (and different) semantics are formally captured by the multiple options that the language's semantic configuration options can take. We show how appropriate setting of the configuration options morphs the Configurable SQL++ semantics into the semantics of 10 surveyed languages, hence providing a compact and formal tool to understand the essential semantic differences between different systems. We briefly comment on the utility of formally capturing semantic variations in polystore systems.Finally we discuss the comparison with prior nested and semistructured query languages (notably OQL and XQuery) and describe a key aspect of query processor implementation: set-oriented semistructured query algebras. In particular, we transfer into the JSON era lessons from the semistructured query processing research of the 90s and 00s and combine them with insights on current JSON databases. Again, the tutorial presents the algebras' fundamentals while it abstracts away modeling differences that are not applicable.",

The huge volume of images shared on social media presents serious challenges and requires large computational infrastructure to ensure successful data processing. However, image gets distorted somehow during the processing, transmission, sharing or from a combination of many factors. So, there is a need to guarantee an acceptable delivery content, especially for image processing applications. In this paper, we present a framework developed to process a large amount of images in real-time while estimating the image quality. Our quality evaluation is measured based on two methods: Perceptual Coherence Measure and Structural Similarity Index. A set of experiments is conducted to evaluate our proposed approach.",

Using the negative log-likelihood as an anomaly score, we evaluate the area under the ROC and precision-recall curves for detecting these faults. The results show very good performance.",

With sampling, data systems can produce approximate answers fast enough for exploratory visualization, at the cost of accuracy and trust. We propose optimistic visualization, which approaches these issues from a user experience perspective. This method lets analysts explore approximate results interactively, and provides a way to detect and recover from errors later. Pangloss implements these ideas. We discuss design issues raised by optimistic visualization systems. We test this concept with five expert visualizers in a laboratory study and three case studies at Microsoft. Analysts reported that they felt more confident in their results, and used optimistic visualization to check that their preliminary results were correct.",

Authors offer a concept of web-based real-time data quality evaluation and improvement system for energy domain. The system evaluates data in real-time based on a set of rules applied by the operator (identifying gaps, outliers, anomalies etc) and classifies cases into categories: errors, warnings and statistics. All cases are registered and tracked by the system. The system creates reports, improves data automatically (performs data imputation using curtain interpolation algorithm) or reacts on manual data modification. domain specific query language allows to create user-defined rules. It contains advanced data checks based on statistics and machine learning methods. The system is designed to be domain independent and to be able to process data from different data sources. The concept was designed and implemented in program code. The functionality of it can be extended by plug-ins written according to special requirements.",

Intelligent transportation can play a very important role in the joint prevention. The work expects to explore the building information modeling (BIM) big data (BD) processing method of digital twins (DTs) of Smart City, thus speeding up the construction of Smart City and improve the accuracy of data processing. During construction, DTs build the same digital copy of the smart city. On this basis, BIM designs the building's keel and structure, optimizing various resources and configurations of the building. Regarding the fast data growth in smart cities, a complex data fusion and efficient learning algorithm, namely Multi-Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), is proposed to process the multi-dimensional and complex BD based on the compositive rough set model. The Bayesian network solves the multi-label classification. Each label is regarded as a Bayesian network node. Then, the structural learning approach is adopted to learn the label Bayesian network's structure from data. On the P53-old and the P53-new datasets, the running time of Multi-GPU decreases as the number of GPUs increases, approaching the ideal linear speedup ratio. With the continuous increase of K value, the deterministic information input into the tag BN will be reduced, thus reducing the classification accuracy. When K=3, MLBN can provide the best data analysis performance. On genbase dataset, the accuracy of MLBN is 0.982 ± 0.013. Through experiments, the BIM BD processing algorithm based on Bayesian Network Structural Learning (BNSL) helps decision-makers use complex data in smart cities efficiently.",

                "abstract": "As a new type of transaction model in the Internet + era, e-commerce has been integrated into people's lives and plays an important role. E-commerce business transactions will inevitably be affected by payment behavior, taxation and other factors. With the rapid development of e-commerce companies, the current financial risk management model of e-commerce companies is no longer able to meet the development requirements of the company. Their financial management and financial status are facing major tests, which directly affect the normal operation of the company. It is increasingly important to strengthen the financial risk management of e-commerce companies. This article takes e-commerce companies as the research object and analyzes financial risk management on the basis of big data. It mainly explores how e-commerce companies do a good job in security management, how to establish and improve corporate financial risk management systems, and then improve corporate financial risk identification and management and control capabilities to ensure the healthy and sustainable development of the company. With the emergence of big data, e-commerce companies have risen sharply, so the competition between them has become increasingly fierce. Therefore, their own financial risks are more strictly controlled. Only by strengthening corporate financial risk management can the company be able to promote stable and long-term development. In the context of Internet+, strengthening the research on financial risk management of e-commerce companies has become a key concern of all sectors of society. This is of great significance for preventing corporate financial risks, improving financial management capabilities and comprehensive competitiveness.",

                "abstract": "The introduction of a Triple-entry blockchain-based accounting system has been suggested in different forms by some authors in various parts of the world. Multiple challenges are currently hindering its introduction. Among many others, this article focuses on two main challenges for adopting blockchain accounting: security and privacy. The primary assumption is that a generalised accounting framework should be developed in a permissioned platform. Accounting data are periodically and mandatorily disclosed in financial statements that summarise the companies’ financial performances. However, accounting books are not expected to be made available to the public, including detailed and sensitive data. Indeed, disclosing all the accounting transactions might compromise the confidentiality of the company know-how, including a list of suppliers, mark-up, a list of customers and so forth. The introduction of a shared ledger might be considered a threat that could jeopardise business big data confidentiality, data security and privacy. This article assesses these perspectives to provide valuable solutions.",

In many scenarios, quantifying the number of remaining errors is challenging because our data integrity rules themselves may be incomplete, or the available gold-standard datasets may be too small to extrapolate. As the use of inherently fallible crowds becomes more prevalent in data cleaning problems, it is important to have estimators to quantify the extent of such errors. We propose novel species estimators to estimate the number of distinct remaining errors in a dataset after it has been cleaned by a set of crowd workers -- essentially, quantifying the utility of hiring additional workers to clean the dataset. This problem requires new estimators that are robust to false positives and false negatives, and we empirically show on three real-world datasets that existing species estimators are unstable for this problem, while our proposed techniques quickly converge.",

If maintained over long periods, interpretation and usage of their schemas often shifts. Therefore, traditional data scrubbing techniques based on existing schema and integrity constraint documentation are hardly applicable. So-called data auditing environments circumvent this problem by using machine learning techniques in order to induce semantically meaningful structures from the actual data, and then classifying outliers that do not fit the induced schema as potential errors.However, as the quality of the analyzed database is a-priori unknown, the design of data auditing environments requires special methods for the calibration of error measurements based on the induced schema. In this paper, we present a data audit test generator that systematically generates and pollutes artificial benchmark databases for this purpose. The test generator has been implemented as part of a data auditing environment based on the well-known machine learning algorithm C4.5.Validation in the partial quality audit of a large service-related database at Daimler-Chrysler shows the usefulness of the approach as a complement to standard data scrubbing.",

Poor clock synchronization can lead to poor data and classifiers. In this paper, we propose a hybrid synchronization approach that combines NTP (Network Time Protocol) and context markers. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly reduces synchronization error (20 ms) when compared to approaches that rely solely on NTP or sensor events. Our proposed approach can be applied to any wearable sensor where an independent sensor stream requires synchronization.",

Due to the dynamic, decentralized, and heterogeneous nature of the IoT, spatial IoT data (SID) quality has attracted considerable attention in academia and industry. How to invent and use technologies for managing spatial data quality and exploiting low-quality spatial data are key challenges in the IoT. In this tutorial, we highlight the SID consumption requirements in applications and offer an overview of spatial data quality in the IoT setting. In addition, we review pertinent technologies for quality management and low-quality data exploitation, and we identify trends and future directions for quality-aware SID management and utilization. The tutorial aims to not only help researchers and practitioners to better comprehend SID quality challenges and solutions, but also offer insights that may enable innovative research and applications.",

Aiming to enhance ubiquitous access of big data such as patient-oriented access of medical archives, we apply complex/multi-context prefetching to reduce latency thereby improving response time. We propose a formal model for prefetch requests rate and network workload or stress bound that takes into account a diverse set of constraints a digital ecosystem could be in. In addition to that, components of our latency hiding framework such as a generic multi-context functional architecture, use case model, medical database model with emphasis on API (abstracted patient information) and a high-level system architecture have been designed. The development of a complex or multi-context prefetch algorithm that uses a patient's chief complaints, slackness sensitivity, popular content tag, user specified contexts and constraints is underway. A prototype system will also be developed to validate the proposed solutions. Moreover, input and output metrics will be developed to gauge the efficiency and effectiveness of the prefetch algorithm under development.",

However, existing systems lack the support for I/O management, and the performance of big-data applications degrades in unpredictable ways when they contend for I/Os. To address this challenge, this paper proposes IBIS, an Interposed Big-data I/O Scheduler, to provide I/O performance differentiation for competing applications in a shared big-data system. IBIS transparently intercepts, isolates, and schedules an application's different phases of I/Os via an I/O interposition layer on every datanode of the big-data system. It provides a new proportional-share I/O scheduler, SFQ(D2), to allow applications to share the I/O service of each datanode with good fairness and resource utilization. It enables the distributed I/O schedulers to coordinate with one another and to achieve proportional sharing of the big-data system's total I/O service in a scalable manner. Finally, it supports the shared use of big-data resources by diverse frameworks and manages the I/Os from different types of big-data workloads (e.g., batch jobs vs. queries) across these frameworks. The prototype of IBIS is implemented in Hadoop/YARN, a widely used big-data system. Experiments based on a variety of representative applications (WordCount, TeraSort, Facebook, TPC-H) show that IBIS achieves good total-service proportional sharing with low overhead in both application performance and resource usages. IBIS is also shown to support various performance policies: it can deliver stronger performance isolation than native Hadoop/YARN (99% better for WordCount and 15% better for TPC-H queries) with good resource utilization; and it can also achieve perfect proportional slowdown with better application performance (30% better than native Hadoop).",

Many new libraries and specialized database management systems (DBMSs) have emerged to support such tasks. It is unclear how well these systems support real-world image analysis use cases, and how performant the image analytics tasks implemented on top of such systems are. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of large-scale image analysis systems using two real-world scientific image data processing use cases. We evaluate five representative systems (SciDB, Myria, Spark, Dask, and TensorFlow) and find that each of them has shortcomings that complicate implementation or hurt performance. Such shortcomings lead to new research opportunities in making large-scale image analysis both efficient and easy to use.",

                "abstract": "In urban Internet of Things (IoT) environments, data generated in real time could be processed by analytical applications in online or offline mode. In the management perspective of runtime environments, such modes can hardly be supported in a unified framework under multiple restrictions such as latency, utility, and QoS (quality of service). Meanwhile in the optimization perspective of specific applications, it is difficult for current infrastructure to efficiently allocate sufficient resources to tasks of an application, simultaneously considering multiple factors such as data size, velocity, and locality. In this article, two task allocation methods are proposed for batch and stream analytics to improve resource utility with auto-scaling guarantee when an analytical application is submitted or sudden workloads appear. Taking the highway domain as an example, the task allocation methods are implemented in a novel combined framework accordingly. Using both real-world and simulated data, extensive experiments show that our methods can improve utility efficiency with effective offload support.",

At present, research on the leadership of college students has become an issue that the education circle generally attaches importance to, and has received widespread attention from the society. In order to understand in detail the influencing factors of the leadership of college students, and then explore an effective way to cultivate leadership, this paper collects the big data related to students in the “Leader Class of Dong Liang Project” (student leadership training program) in X School of a “Double Top” university in western China and compares them with those of non-“Leader Class” students, and finds that there are obvious differences between the two groups in academic performance, student leader experience and leadership training project experience. Subsequently, based on the questionnaire analysis of 375 college students, it further proves that the experience of serving as student leaders and leadership training program has a significant positive effect on the improvement of leadership of college students. On this basis, it is suggested that to cultivate the leadership of college students, we should pay attention to the construction and development of student societies, build a benign community ecology of students, integrate Internet technology to optimize the training mode of student leaders and build an innovative training platform for the leadership of college students.",

Previous Research In The Large workshops have sought to establish base-line practice in this area. We have seen the use of app stores as being successful as a methodology for gathering large amounts of data, leading to design implications, but we have yet to explore the full potential for this data's use and interpretation. How is it possible to leverage the practices of large-scale research, beyond the current approaches, to more directly inform future designs? We propose that the time is right to re-energise discussions on large-scale research, looking further than the basic methodological issues and assessing the potential for informing the design of new mobile software.",

Some current techniques (e.g., cognitive architectures) are able to model people's goals and actions from little data, but have poor predictive capabilities. Other methods (e.g., deep networks) have strong predictive capabilities but require large amounts of data to train the model; such abundant empirical data on human performance is not available for many human-based tasks. We show a novel and general method of generating copious synthetic data of human behavior using a cognitive architecture, and then use the data to train a deep network classifier to predict ensuing human actions. We test our approach by predicting human actions on a supervisory control task; the results show that our approach provides superior prediction when compared to training a classifier with only (limited) empirical data.",

The challenges towards this accomplishment are: 1) the complexity of lithography machines which are composed of hundreds of mechanical and optical components, 2) the high rate and volume data acquisition from different lithography and metrology machines, and 3) the scarcity of performance measurements due to their cost. This paper addresses these challenges by 1) visualizing and ranking the most relevant factors to a performance metric, 2) organizing efficiently Big Data from different sources and 3) predicting the performance with machine learning when measurements are lacking. Even though this project targets semiconductor manufacturing, its methodology is applicable to any case of monitoring complex systems, with many potentially interesting features, and imbalanced datasets.",

According to the progress of the times and the changes of society, it is very important and necessary to constantly optimize and perfect the existing teaching mode and personnel training mode. Big data is used in all aspects of the computer industry, especially the recommendation information for a single user is a common application, which brings a lot of inspiration to the education industry. In teaching, we can use big data to analyze children, and know what children need, what courses they are interested in, and how they react to different teachers' teaching methods. Facing the new situation, new tasks and new opportunities for development, normal vocational colleges should speed up the training of high-quality preschool teachers to meet the needs of the whole society for the development of preschool education. Based on this, this paper discusses and analyzes the reform path of pre-school education talents training in higher vocational colleges under big data.",

This thesis is oriented towards this problem, and combined with deep learning algorithms to build a user intent prediction model based on the existing knowledge map. By extracting user characteristics and using a dynamic matching algorithm, the purpose of intent prediction is achieved. In this way, the required standards and requirements can be found faster and more directly in the work process, which effectively improves the working efficiency of employees and reduces the difficulty of learning and training.",

To solve the problem, we propose a novel semantic routing system that leverages geo-tagged rich crowdsourced multimedia information such as images, audio, video and text to add semantics to the conventional routing. Our proposed system includes a Semantic Multimedia Routing Algorithm (SMRA) that uses an indexed spatial big data environment to answer multimedia spatio-temporal queries in real-time. The results are customized to the users' smartphone bandwidth and resolution requirements. The system has been designed to be able to handle a very large number of multimedia spatio-temporal requests at any given moment. A proof of concept of the system will be demonstrated through two scenarios. These are 1) multimedia enhanced routing and 2) finding lost individuals in a large crowd using multimedia. We plan to test the system's performance and usability during Hajj 2015, where over four million pilgrims from all over the world gather to perform their rituals.",

Vi-POC (Virtual Power Operating Center) project aims at designing and implementing a prototype which is able to achieve this goal. Due to the heterogeneity and the high volume of data, it is necessary to exploit suitable Big Data analysis techniques in order to perform a quick and secure access to data that cannot be obtained with traditional approaches for data management. In this paper, we describe Vi-POC -- a distributed system for storing huge amounts of data, gathered from energy production plants and weather prediction services. We use HBase over Hadoop framework on a cluster of commodity servers in order to provide a system that can be used as a basis for running machine learning algorithms. Indeed, we perform one-day ahead forecast of PV energy production based on Artificial Neural Networks in two learning settings, that is, structured and non-structured output prediction. Preliminary experimental results confirm the validity of the approach, also when compared with a baseline approach.",

As a consequence, generating histograms on database tables is typically performed as a batch job, separately from query processing. In this paper, we show how to calculate statistics as a side effect of data movement within a DBMS using a hardware accelerator in the data path. This accelerator analyzes tables as they are transmitted from storage to the processing unit, and provides histograms on the data retrieved for queries at virtually no extra performance cost. To evaluate our approach, we implemented this accelerator on an FPGA. This prototype calculates histograms faster and with similar or better accuracy than commercial databases. Moreover, the FPGA can provide various types of histograms such as Equi-depth, Compressed, or Max-diff on the same input data in parallel, without additional overhead.",

                "abstract": "Recent years have seen an explosion of data volumes from a myriad of distributed sources such as ubiquitous cameras and various sensors. The challenges of analyzing these geographically dispersed datasets are increasing due to the significant data movement overhead, time-consuming data aggregation, and escalating energy needs. Rather than constantly move a tremendous amount of raw data to remote warehouse-scale computing systems for processing, it would be beneficial to leverage in-situ server systems (InS) to pre-process data, i.e., bringing computation to where the data is located.This paper takes the first step towards designing server clusters for data processing in the field. We investigate two representative in-situ computing applications, where data is normally generated from environmentally sensitive areas or remote places that lack established utility infrastructure. These very special operating environments of in-situ servers urge us to explore standalone (i.e., off-grid) systems that offer the opportunity to benefit from local, self-generated energy sources. In this work we implement a heavily instrumented proof-of-concept prototype called InSURE: in-situ server systems using renewable energy. We develop a novel energy buffering mechanism and a unique joint spatio-temporal power management strategy to coordinate standalone power supplies and in-situ servers. We present detailed deployment experiences to quantify how our design fits with in-situ processing in the real world. Overall, InSURE yields 20%~60% improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline. It maintains impressive control effectiveness in under-provisioned environment and can economically scale along with the data processing needs. The proposed design is well complementary to today's grid-connected cloud data centers and provides competitive cost-effectiveness.",

                "abstract": "Recent years have seen an explosion of data volumes from a myriad of distributed sources such as ubiquitous cameras and various sensors. The challenges of analyzing these geographically dispersed datasets are increasing due to the significant data movement overhead, time-consuming data aggregation, and escalating energy needs. Rather than constantly move a tremendous amount of raw data to remote warehouse-scale computing systems for processing, it would be beneficial to leverage in-situ server systems (InS) to pre-process data, i.e., bringing computation to where the data is located.This paper takes the first step towards designing server clusters for data processing in the field. We investigate two representative in-situ computing applications, where data is normally generated from environmentally sensitive areas or remote places that lack established utility infrastructure. These very special operating environments of in-situ servers urge us to explore standalone (i.e., off-grid) systems that offer the opportunity to benefit from local, self-generated energy sources. In this work we implement a heavily instrumented proof-of-concept prototype called InSURE: in-situ server systems using renewable energy. We develop a novel energy buffering mechanism and a unique joint spatio-temporal power management strategy to coordinate standalone power supplies and in-situ servers. We present detailed deployment experiences to quantify how our design fits with in-situ processing in the real world. Overall, InSURE yields 20%~60% improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline. It maintains impressive control effectiveness in under-provisioned environment and can economically scale along with the data processing needs. The proposed design is well complementary to today's grid-connected cloud data centers and provides competitive cost-effectiveness.",

In order to give full play to the role of mathematical teaching resources under the background of big data, this paper designs an accurate recommendation process, compares commonly used recommendation algorithms, and builds an accurate recommendation process for mathematical resources based on content recommendation.

This work demonstrates that the solution space of these challenges has expanded with deep learning now moving beyond traditional applications in computer vision and natural language processing to diverse and core machine learning tasks such as learning with streaming and non-iid-data, partial supervision, and large volumes of distributed data while preserving privacy. We present a framework coalescing multiple deep methods and corresponding models as responses to specific Big Data challenges. First, we perform a detailed per-challenge review of existing techniques, with benchmarks and usage advice, and subsequently synthesize them together into one organic construct that we discover principally uses extensions of one underlying model, the autoencoder. This work therefore provides a synthesis where challenges at scale across the Vs of Big Data could be addressed by new algorithms and architectures being proposed in the deep learning community. The value being proposed to the reader from either community in terms of nomenclature, concepts, and techniques of the other would advance the cause of multi-disciplinary, transversal research and accelerate the advance of technology in both domains.",

How to efficiently mine the hidden information of these massive data information is the key to scientific and social development, which requires big data analysis technology. The solidification process of metals is a very complex process, including both macroscopic and microscopic processes. Molecular dynamics can simulate the process of liquid metal solidification from a microscopic scale. In molecular dynamics simulation, the more particles the simulation system contains, the more accurate the data obtained. However, the molecular dynamics serial program runs slowly, and the number of simulated atoms is limited, which makes the simulation results far from the real situation. The rise of parallel computing provides conditions for large-scale molecular dynamics parallelization and promotes the rapid development of molecular dynamics parallelization. The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamic parallel algorithm of liquid metal solidification molecules based on big data. In this paper, through in-depth research on big data, analysis of the current research results of parallel computing of liquid metal solidification molecules, and combined with the current research status of liquid metal solidification molecules in my country, to discuss the research of liquid metal solidification molecular dynamics parallel algorithm under big data. Research shows that the spatial domain decomposition method is more general, and its communication cost is relatively small. It reflects that it can obtain relatively high parallel performance and computing efficiency in local communication, especially in large-scale simulation systems with a large number of atoms.",

In order to promote the rapid development of pure electric vehicle industry, Firstly, combined with the big data of consumers' car purchase, this paper analyzes the influencing factors of electric vehicle sales, and then conduct a questionnaire on customers and car owners who have purchased vehicles in different Direct stores of Wei lai automobile, The reliability and validity of the questionnaire were verified by SPSS data processing software, and the hypotheses were effectively verified by regression analysis. The analysis results show that the assumption that the product performance image, brand image, consumers' perception of Wei lai pure electric vehicles and government policies have a significant impact on the sales of Wei lai vehicles is correct. Accordingly, the corresponding specific measures are put forward.",

By using big data, educators can know students' lives as a whole and predict students' conditions in advance. However, it is difficult to guide students to rationally use big data and effectively integrate and refine big data. Under the condition of a large amount of data, educators must change their ideas and set up data awareness. They also need to integrate data and realize resource sharing. They should improve their professional quality and the skills to put big data into their education life, try to integrate traditional ideological and political education methods and big data technology, enhance and ameliorate the corresponding work of education in universities so as to blaze new trails in modern times.",

Two interesting problems that have received a lot of attention in OSNs is how to provide effective ways to understand and predict how users behave, and how to build accurate models for specific domains (e.g., marketing campaigns). In this context, stochastic multi-agent based simulation can be employed to reproduce the behavior observed in OSNs. Nevertheless, the first step to build an accurate behavior model is to create an agent-based system. Hence, a modeler needs not only to be effective, but also to scale up given the huge volume of streaming graph data. To tackle the above challenges, this paper proposes a MapReduce-based method to build a modeler to handle big data. We demonstrate in our experiments how efficient and effective our proposal is using the Obama's Twitter network on the 2012 U.S. presidential election.",

Through the form of an expert questionnaire, the relatively important system indicators are selected and the indicator weights are calculated. Analyse the existing problems and put forward optimization suggestions; innovative research methods, this paper uses supply chain management performance indicators to measure the level of supply chain management optimization, combined with factor analysis to find out the factors that affect the supply chain optimization of cross-border e-commerce importers. Analysing the implementation effect of cross-border e-commerce policy system, exploring effective policy \"combinations\" to promote the development of cross-border e-commerce, and realizing the quantitative analysis of the whole process of cross-border e-commerce policy from policy choice, policy implementation to the response to international trade shocks is an effective way to ensure that the policy system is formulated scientifically and rationally and to solve the problem of police inefficiency and maladaptation.",

They can also straightforwardly be employed in the same study by contrasting the results of a theory-driven M&S model with the most accurate data-driven ML model. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from seeing ML and M&S as two independent activities to identifying how their integration can solve challenges that emerge in a big data context. Since several works have already examined this interaction for conceptual modeling or model building (e.g., creating components with ML and embedding them in the M&S model), our analysis is devoted on three relatively under-studied stages: calibrating a simulation model using ML, dealing with the issues of large search space by employing ML for experimentation, and identifying the right visualizations of model output by applying ML to characteristics of the output or actions of the users.",

Currently, deploying data-intensive computing software framework on HPC clusters still faces performance and scalability issues. In this paper, we develop a new two-level storage system by integrating Tachyon, an in-memory file system with OrangeFS, a parallel file system. We model the I/O throughputs of four storage structures: HDFS, OrangeFS, Tachyon and two-level storage. We conduct computational experiments to characterize I/O throughput behavior of two-level storage and compare its performance to that of HDFS and OrangeFS, using TeraSort benchmark. Theoretical models and experimental tests both show that the two-level storage system can increase the aggregate I/O throughputs. This work lays a solid foundation for future work in designing and building HPC systems that can provide a better support on I/O intensive workloads with preserving existing computing resources.",

Analyzing the influencing factors of network public opinion risks and constructing a risk evaluation index system can effectively evaluate risks, not only provide scientific basis for government governance, but also provide a more valuable basis for the clarity and guidance of big data environment. Combining PSR and AHP, the risk evaluation index system of emergency network public opinion was constructed, the weight of each index was calculated by MATLAB, and the case of \"Epidemic situation in Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province\" is analyzed by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The PSR model is introduced to analyze the life evolution cycle of online public opinion of emergencies. According to the weight results of online public opinion risk evaluation index of emergencies, it was concluded that the risk of \"Epidemic situation in Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province\" was between the third-level risk and the fourth-level risk, it is indicate that the risk evaluation results are consistent with the actual situation.

In practice, both are tedious, time-consuming tasks and are often neglected by end users, who are typically not aware of workload semantics, sizes of intermediate data, and cluster specification.To address these problems, we present Juggler, an end-to-end framework, which autonomously selects appropriate datasets for caching and recommends a correspondingly suitable cluster configuration to end users, with the aim of achieving optimal execution time and cost. We evaluate Juggler on various iterative, real-world, machine learning applications. Compared with our baseline, Juggler reduces execution time to 25.1% and cost to 58.1%, on average, as a result of selecting suitable datasets for caching. It recommends optimal cluster configuration in 50% of cases and near-to-optimal configuration in the remaining cases. Moreover, Juggler achieves an average performance prediction accuracy of 90%.",

                "abstract": "Whole genome re-sequencing plays a crucial role in biomedical studies. The emergence of genomic big data calls for an enormous amount of computing power. However, current computational methods are inefficient in utilizing available computational resources. In this paper, we address this challenge by optimizing the utilization of the fastest supercomputer in the world - TH-2 supercomputer. TH-2 is featured by its neo-heterogeneous architecture, in which each compute node is equipped with 2 Intel Xeon CPUs and 3 Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors. The heterogeneity and the massive amount of data to be processed pose great challenges for the deployment of the genome analysis software pipeline on TH-2. Runtime profiling shows that SOAP3-dp and SOAPsnp are the most time-consuming components (up to 70% of total runtime) in a typical genome-analyzing pipeline. To optimize the whole pipeline, we first devise a number of parallel and optimization strategies for SOAP3-dp and SOAPsnp, respectively targeting each node to fully utilize all sorts of hardware resources provided both by CPU and MIC. We also employ a few scaling methods to reduce communication between different nodes. We then scaled up our method on TH-2. With 8192 nodes, the whole analyzing procedure took 8.37 hours to finish the analysis of a 300 TB dataset of whole genome sequences from 2,000 human beings, which can take as long as 8 months on a commodity server. The speedup is about 700x.",

While covering basic functionalities implicitly, the details of the individual contributions to the overall performance are hidden. As a result, end-to-end benchmarks could be biased toward certain basic functions. Micro-benchmarks are more explicit at covering basic functionalities but they are usually targeted at some highly specialized functions. In this paper we present CoreBigBench, a benchmark that focuses on the most common big data engines/platforms functionalities like scans, two way joins, common UDF execution and more. These common functionalities are benchmarked over relational and key-value data models which covers majority of data models. The benchmark consists of 22 queries applied to sales data and key-value web logs covering the basic functionalities. We ran CoreBigBench on Hive as a proof of concept and verified that the benchmark is easy to deploy and collected performance data. Finally, we believe that CoreBigBench is a good fit for commercial big data engines performance testing focused on basic engine functionalities not covered in end-to-end benchmarks.",

Firstly, the road network map is divided into grid and numbered, and the feature points obtained with direction angle, then transform original trajectory into feature grid trajectory sequence by preprocessing such as matching and completion. Then, the common sequence of the trajectory is obtained from a large number of taxi historical data, and the standard K trajectory between the start point and the end point is obtained by clustering. When the real-time trajectory detection, it is matched with the standard K trajectory, only edit distance of two trajectory need to be calculated considering the spatial-temporal threshold. Finally, based on the real data set of taxi GPS trajectory in Beijing from March to May 2011, a large number of experiments are carried out, and verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

Perhaps one of the most visible obstacles to this is the large amount of data involved. Indeed, the magnitude of stored data which implies its constant acquisition and generation, is rapidly growing to Terabyte systems through to Petabyte systems. By designing a near real time environmental monitoring system based on GOES-R next generation satellite imagery, we show in this paper that current tools actually allow the proper management of such amount of data and enable the integration of a variety of data sources that makes possible the rapid analysis of one of the most voluminous spatial dataset available.",

Based on the network big data as the data source, this paper analyzes the spatial distribution and spatial-temporal pattern of house prices in the main city zone of Kunming through the Getis-Ord Gi* index and Kriging method, and quantifies the spatial-temporal changes of house prices through statistical analysis and spatial overlay analysis. The result shows that in hot and cold spot analysis, hot spot (high house price agglomeration area) is surrounded by cold spot (low house price agglomeration area), and Chenggong District is the cold spot dominant area. The house price in the main city zone of Kunming forms two high-value areas in the spatial distribution, and presents a pile-shaped ring structure with a central high price and low price in circumference. During the study period, the overall house price fluctuations were small, showing a pattern of north high and south low. The results of statistical analysis and spatial overlay analysis show that there is a significant difference in house prices among various administrative districts. The high-value clusters and low-value clusters in house prices are randomly distributed in various administrative regions. The price changes in Chenggong District are the most significant, and Panlong District has the smallest change.",

However, little is known about the relationship between stakeholders, their knowledge about the IS, security documentation and how quality aspects influence the security and risk properties of the IS under investigation. We developed a structured data quality assessment process to identify quality issues in the security documentation of an information system. For this, organizational stakeholders were interviewed about the IS under investigation and models were created from their description in the context of an ongoing security risk management process process. Then, the research model was evaluated in a case study. We found that contradictions between the models created from stakeholder interviews and those created from documentation were a good indicator for potential security risks. The findings indicate that the proposed data quality assessment process provides valuable inputs for the ongoing security and risk management process. While current research considers users as the most important resource in security and risk management processes, little is known about the hidden value of various entities of documentation available at the organizational level. This study highlights the importance of utilizing existing IS security documentation in the security and risk management process and provides risk managers with a toolset for the prioritization of security documentation driven improvement activities.",

Often the data is not static, but arrives continuously in large data streams, which ideally are processed and leveraged in real-time. This talk will present a modular and flexible platform for real-time big data stream processing, complex event detection, data science and machine learning with an easy-to-use visual process design user interface, seamlessly integrating the most relevant big data and stream processing frameworks (Hadoop, Spark, Spark Streaming, Kafka, Flink, etc.) within one unifying platform and user interface, based on the widely used data science platform RapidMiner.This talk will also provide an overview of applications of this framework across many industries like machine failure prediction and prevention and predictive maintenance in industrial production in the manufacturing industry, criticial event detection, prediction and prevention in the chemical indutry, product quality prediction and optimization as well as energy consumption and cost reduction in the steel and metal industry, data-driven process optimization in the food and beverage industry, various use cases in the automotive and aviation industry, maritime data analysis to detect complex events like piracy or illegal fishing and to avoid collisions, drug effectiveness prediction for cancer drug development and biomedical research, financial time series analysis and forecasting for the investment industry. The latter three use cases are addresed in the European reseach projects INFORE, which will also be shortly introduced.",

We show that forward-looking financial analysis on the systemic level needs a data structure that represents financial contracts as algorithms that produce state contingent cash flows. Currently the industry lacks such a standard, which precludes meaningful systemic forward-looking analysis. We introduce ACTUS as an emerging standard that will enable consistent analysis on all levels. This standard will also create an infrastructure for macro financial analysis.",

Facing the growing management information, it is inevitable to carry out education management innovation to meet the needs of the times. The use of teachers' resources and the assessment of teachers' classroom teaching quality must be solved by modern means to achieve the rational use and optimal allocation of teaching resources and improve the effectiveness of teaching management. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of big data(BD) technology in the innovation of university education management. This paper uses case study and literature research methods, combines data warehousing and data mining technologies in BD technology for evaluating teaching data with data warehousing as an organizational tool, and analyzes the current situation and future development trends of database technology data application in information management of educational administration construction in universities. The experimental results show that the ID3 algorithm performs better when there are fewer number of things and is about 10 seconds faster than the Apriori algorithm. But when the number of things are much more, the Apriori algorithm is significantly better than the ID3 algorithm. Moreover, the Apriori algorithm is more suitable for mining the deep laws of ungrasped objective things, and reveals unknown dependencies between data for rule mining with fuzzy concepts. Therefore, through analysis of data warehouse, data mining techniques and mining algorithms, by data mining of a large amount of assessment data, this paper finds that combining decision trees and association rule algorithms in data mining algorithms with teaching systems, data mining techniques introduced in educational assessment systems for assessment, not only improves the scientific nature of educational management, but also improves the effectiveness of digital education construction.",

In today's era of big data, great changes have taken place in translation, from the traditional manual translation at the beginning to the current machine translation. The advantage of machine translation lies in its fast translation speed and low cost, but certain errors will also occur in the translated translation. The translation errors of professional terms account for a larger proportion, which greatly affects the quality of the translation. At the same time, professional terminology is the core knowledge in the article, which will directly affect people's understanding of technical information in the professional field. The purpose of this article is to study the English machine translation standards of professional terms in the context of big data. This article focuses on the English machine translation of professional terms, and analyzes the English machine translation standards of professional terms in the context of big data based on relevant research at home and abroad. This article will analyze its professional terminology translation standards from all aspects, summarize and summarize the translation standards studied by various scholars, analyze the factors that affect translation standards, and discover various characteristics of translation standards. At the same time, in order to solve the shortcomings of machine translation in the translation of professional terminology in the past, this article attempts to summarize a set of objective and comprehensive English machine translation system evaluation standards for professional terminology, so as to improve its use efficiency. The experimental results show that from the ranking results, the highest comprehensive evaluation score is candidate translation 1, and the weight is as high as 27%. In the analysis of the translation results, information characteristics are added to reorder the candidate translations, and the most suitable context and the best translation are selected.",

In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient parallel solution for incremental gradient descent in GLADE. We provide empirical evidence that our solution is limited only by the physical hardware characteristics, uses effectively the available resources, and achieves maximum scalability. When deployed in the cloud, our solution has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of complex analytics over massive datasets.",

Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) has been repeatedly shown to be successful at providing an accurate model of student knowledge in more traditional classroom settings, and recent research has explored the application of BKT to MOOCs with promising results. Using data from several MOOCs run by Stanford university, we propose to extend earlier research into the application of BKT to MOOCS by developing a framework within which the use of course resources and student performance can be leveraged both to increase the predictive accuracy of BKT modeling and to provide an evaluative metric for the utility of those resources. We hope that such a framework can contribute not only to MOOC courses, but traditional classrooms as well.",

The physical world interaction with the cyber world is stored as a rich gesture semantics with the help of multiple media streams, which is then uploaded to a tightly synchronized cyber physical cloud environment for deducing real-time and historical whole-body Range of Motion (ROM) kinematic data.",
