Carrying out ideological education for college student (CS)s with the help of BD technology is conducive to the implementation of the party's educational policy, the implementation of the fundamental task of cultivating people with morality, and the training of qualified builders and reliable successors of socialism with Chinese characteristics, who are both red and professional, have both ability and political integrity, and comprehensive development people. The purpose of this article is to analyze the role of BD in the process of targeted ideological education for CSs from the perspective of BD, and use this as an opportunity to identify the current problems encountered in the process of using BD to carry out targeted ideological and political education (IAPE). Promote the pertinence of CSs' IAPE. The methods used in this article include literature research method, induction method and case analysis method, using the four major business system data of CSs during the school period and applying BD technology to study the pertinence of contemporary CSs' ideological education. The study found that the use of BD methods can make up for the shortcomings of traditional research, and many practical conclusions have been obtained. For example, the comprehensive student data obtained by the application of BD technology shows that the overall scores of students’ thoughts tend to be stable between two higher scores. The numbers are 46% and 38%, indicating that most students perform well in school and the overall evaluation is good. The scores of students who have committed violations of discipline and penalties are relatively low, but only account for 6%, which is relatively low.",

Aiming at the characteristics of the large-capacity, multi-type, and high-growth data collection in the education field, the use of big data technology for aggregation, classification, analysis, and reorganization is the only way to promote the high-quality development of education and complete the modernization of education. Based on the big data mining of the National Bureau of Statistics and Baidu Index, using literature data, knowledge graphs, mathematical statistics and logical analysis, the time characteristics of primary school English online attention, attributes of concerned people and factors affecting the English learning needs of netizens are explored and analyzed. The results show that there is no seasonally significant difference in the time characteristics of primary school English online attention. \"Learning\" is the main demand for primary school English attention, but there is a group preference of \"focusing on knowledge and neglecting skills\". Therefore, in the context of the era of \"big data + education\", giving play to the guiding role of education policy and education evaluation, stimulating and leading netizens to correct and healthy online attention, is crucial to achieving high-quality development of primary school English education.",

Both in the international world and also in Indonesia. The number of cases that have occurred for several years have only been uncovered, resulting in large losses for users of financial statements and stakeholders. The industrial revolution 4.0 opens up new opportunities, with the existence of big data analytics and forensic audits, which are expected to increase professional skepticism of auditors to be more observant in detecting fraudulent financial reports. Our research is a quantitative study, we tested the hypothesis between the independent variable and the moderating variable on the dependent variable. The independent variables in our research are professional skepticism, and big data analytics, then the moderating variable is forensic accounting, and the dependent variable is financial statement fraud detection. The object of our research is the auditor in a public accounting firm. We used the structural equation modeling partial least square as our data analysis. The results of our study state that professional skepticism, big data analytics have a significant impact on financial statement fraud detection. Forensic accounting moderate both professional skepticism and big data analytics.",

However, it is impossible to achieve that when a data lake does not have a metadata governance system that progressively capitalizes on all the performed analysis experiments. The objective of this paper is to have an easily accessible, reusable data lake that capitalizes on all user experiences. To meet this need, we propose an analysis-oriented metadata model for data lakes. This model includes the descriptive information of datasets and their attributes, as well as all metadata related to the machine learning analyzes performed on these datasets. To illustrate our metadata solution, we implemented a web application of data lake metadata management. This application allows users to find and use existing data, processes and analyses by searching relevant metadata stored in a NoSQL data store within the data lake. To demonstrate how to easily discover metadata with the application, we present two use cases, with real data, including datasets similarity detection and machine learning guidance.",

It is difficult for ordinary database technology to efficiently manage and utilize these data and their hidden important information. Under the background of cloud computing, the main purpose of big data information processing is to realize data clustering. Cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning process, which aims to classify the data of a group of category attribute positions under certain requirements, and make the data similarity between these categories as low as possible, and the data similarity within the categories as high as possible. In this paper, an optimized clustering algorithm for big data in cloud storage based on optimized particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed, and the improved design of big data clustering algorithm is carried out by using particle swarm optimization algorithm.",

                "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing has found a variety of applications e.g., spectrum sensing, environmental monitoring by leveraging the “wisdom” of a potentially large crowd of mobile users. An important metric of a crowdsensing task is data accuracy, which relies on the data quality of the participating users’ data e.g., users’ received SNRs for measuring a transmitter’s transmit signal strength. However, the quality of a user can be its private information which, e.g., may depend on the user’s location that it can manipulate to its own advantage, which can mislead the crowdsensing requester about the knowledge of the data’s accuracy. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the user can also manipulate its effort made in the crowdsensing task, which is a hidden action that could result in the requester having incorrect knowledge of the data’s accuracy. In this paper, we devise truthful crowdsensing mechanisms for Quality and Effort Elicitation QEE, which incentivize strategic users to truthfully reveal their private quality and truthfully make efforts as desired by the requester. The QEE mechanisms achieve the truthful design by overcoming the intricate dependency of a user’s data on its private quality and hidden effort. Under the QEE mechanisms, we show that the crowdsensing requester’s optimal RO effort assignment assigns effort only to the best user that has the smallest “virtual valuation”, which depends on the user’s quality and the quality’s distribution. We also show that, as the number of users increases, the performance gap between the RO effort assignment and the socially optimal effort assignment decreases, and converges to 0 asymptotically. We further discuss some extensions of the QEE mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate the truthfulness of the QEE mechanisms and the system efficiency of the RO effort assignment.",

Therefore, this type of information has to be properly filtered, extracted and processed to avoid noisy and inaccurate results. The main goal of this work is to propose architecture and workflow able to process Twitter social network data in near real-time. The primary design of the introduced modern architecture covers all processing aspects from data ingestion and storing to data processing and analysing. This paper presents Apache Spark and Hadoop implementation. The secondary objective is to analyse tweets with the defined topic --- floods. The word frequency method (Word Clouds) is shown as a major tool to analyse the content of the input dataset. The experimental architecture confirmed the usefulness of many well-known functions of Spark and Hadoop in the social data domain. The platforms which were used provided effective tools for optimal data ingesting, storing as well as processing and analysing. Based on the analytical part, it was observed that the word frequency method (n-grams) can effectively reveal the tweets content. According to the results of this study, the tweets proved their high informative potential regarding data quality and quantity.",

Due in part to the dynamic, decentralized, and heterogeneous architecture of the IoT, the varying and often low quality of spatial IoT data (SID) presents challenges to applications built on top of this data. This survey aims to provide unique insight to practitioners who intend to develop IoT-enabled applications and to researchers who wish to conduct research that relates to data quality in the IoT setting. The survey offers an inventory analysis of major data quality dimensions in SID and covers significant data characteristics and associated quality considerations. The survey summarizes data quality related technologies from both task and technique perspectives. Organizing the technologies from the task perspective, it covers recent progress in SID quality management, encompassing location refinement, uncertainty elimination, outlier removal, fault correction, data integration, and data reduction; and it covers low-quality SID exploitation, encompassing querying, analysis, and decision-making techniques. Finally, the survey covers emerging trends and open issues concerning the quality of SID.",

We evaluate this approach in the context of an existing river basin monitoring program called the Intelligent River®. Our current methods for data quality evaluation are compared with the ontology-based inference methods described in this paper. We present an architecture that incorporates semantic inference into a publish/subscribe messaging middleware, allowing data quality inference to occur on real-time data streams. Our preliminary benchmark results indicate delays of 100ms for basic data quality checks based on an existing semantic web software framework. We demonstrate how these results can be maintained under increasing sensor data traffic rates by allowing inference software agents to work in parallel. These results indicate that data quality inference using the semantic sensor network paradigm is viable solution for data intensive, large-scale sensor networks.",

Big data is characterized by large data scale and long calculation cycle. In order to speed up the calculation speed and shorten the calculation cycle, distributed computing method is one of the effective methods to solve the above problems. With the wide application and rapid development of information technology, cloud computing as a new business computing model has attracted more and more attention. However, the security of cloud computing data storage model lacks reliability. Under the mainstream cloud computing and big data basic environment, building a better model from resource aggregation to analysis and mining, and modeling distributed big data analysis can provide high-reliability, high-security, high-efficiency analysis services for practical analysis and mining applications such as intelligence judgment, information deployment and control, stakeholder analysis and intelligent decision-making.",

For the education industry, under the background of BDT, the integration of CT and modern teaching system can provide new development thinking and new direction for the reform of modern education. In order to study what effect the combination of the two will bring, this paper selects two universities and their students as the experimental research objects to explore how the modern teaching system will be innovated and developed under the effect of this new technology. The experimental results show that the students of a university who have applied CT in the modern teaching system have a high degree of satisfaction, and the percentage of those who are satisfied has reached 67%. Moreover, the score of teaching and research group of a university is relatively high, and the highest score is 95.",

This paper, to overcome the obstacle, assumes that the asset return follows the AD-DG jump-diffusion process whose shape parameters can be any non-negative real numbers to tackle the problems.The algorithm in this article , making use of the additivity of Gamma distribution and the Monte Carlo Simulation ,overcomes the curse of dimensionality based on the big data simulation to price the bond, which is simpler and more precise. Therefore,the pricing approach in this paper has extended and improved other models mentioned above.CCS CONCEPTS • Computing methodologies∼Modeling and simulation∼Model development and analysis∼Modeling methodologies",

                "abstract": "Today's Cross Domain Communication (CDC) infrastructure primarily consists of vendor-specific guard products that have little inter-domain coordination at runtime. Unaware of the context and the semantics of the CDC message that is being processed, the guard heavily relies on rudimentary filtering techniques. Consequently, the information domains are rendered vulnerable to an array of attacks, and countering these attacks often necessitates time-consuming human intervention to adjudicate messages in order to meet the desired security and privacy requirements of the communicating domains. Subsequently, this causes significant performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a set of key requirements and design principles for a service oriented CDC security infrastructure in form of a CDC Reference Architecture, featuring Domain Associated Guards (DOGs) as active work ow participants. Our proposed framework, SAFE, is secure and adaptable. SAFE also provide the foundation for the development of protocols and ontologies enabling run-time coordination among CDC elements. This enables more flexible, interoperable, and efficient CDC designs to serve mission needs, specifically among critical infrastructure domains as well as domains with significantly differing security and privacy vocabulary. To the best of our knowledge, SAFE is the first effort to employ DOG for secure CDC, unlike existing solutions with link-associated guards. Because of the DOG approach, SAFE overcomes the scalability problems encountered by exiting solutions.",

They have made positive contributions to the research of machine translation in natural language processing and have made them increasingly mature. This article uses artificial intelligence big data technology to establish a machine translation bilingual prediction database. The content of the experiment is to conduct translation research on Chinese and English bilinguals through the machine translation bilingual prediction database. The main test is to test the accuracy of the number of sentences under different retrieval structures.

Many communities from several fields (LHCb, Belle II, Creatis, DIRAC4EGI multiple community portal, etc.) use DIRAC to run jobs in distributed environments. Google created the MapReduce programming model offering an efficient way of performing distributed computation over large data sets. Several enterprises are providing Hadoop cloud based resources to their users, and are trying to simplify the usage of Hadoop in the cloud.Based in these two robust technologies, we have created BigDataDIRAC, a solution which gives users the opportunity to access multiple Big Data resources scattered in different geographical areas, such as access to grid resources. This approach opens the possibility of offering not only grid and cloud to the users, but also Big Data resources from the same DIRAC environment. Proof of concept is shown using three computing centers in two countries, and with four Hadoop clusters. Our results demonstrate the ability of BigDataDIRAC to manage jobs driven by dataset location stored in the Hadoop File System (HDFS) of the Hadoop distributed clusters. DIRAC is used to monitor the execution, collect the necessary statistical data, and upload the results from the remote HDFS to the SandBox Storage machine. The tests produced the equivalent of 5 days continuous processing.",

We describe the reasoning behind these two concentrations and how these two concentrations came to exist. All Computer Science majors must choose one of these 12 credit hour concentrations after completing the core Computer Science courses. Though there have been many model undergraduate programs and graduate programs in Data Science in the nation [14], [15], [16] we believe that our concentration in Big Data Analytics is a unique offering, especially in our state. The concentration in Big Data Analytics covers predictive analytics, cloud and distributed computing and data mining. The concentration in Software Development follows a modified version of the IEEE/ACM software engineering curriculum recommendations [3]. Both concentrations finish with a semester-long capstone course.",

In the era of big data, the scientific research field of sports training is gradually beginning to adopt the big data model for development, which will better form a new insight after data generation, collection, analysis and transformation. Therefore, this paper analyzes the application of big data intelligent cleaning system based on cloud computing in physical function training management. Students can quickly query running results through WEB query system, and administrators can download and modify students' results through WEB system. By using big data analysis technology, students are grouped according to their physical fitness test scores and BMI index, and their sports plans are formulated accordingly. A high-reliability real-time wireless receiving and sending sports monitoring system for big data is adopted, which realizes the functions of networking, unmanned and intelligent sports management.",

According to incomplete statistics, people spend at least 15 years in school for education in their lifetime, which does not include the graduate level. To lay the foundation for this long period of school education is the pre-school education stage. The early childhood period is the most important stage of the intellectual development of life, and it is also the foundation of education. This paper uses Web data mining technology to provide personalized services to the online preschool education and learning platform, to study the interests and learning habits of preschool children, to choose more needed resources for students, and to provide better services. The survey report shows that more than 50% of students use the online learning platform for more than one hour a day, and even 5% of students use the cloud platform to study for more than 3 hours a day. The survey report also shows that 92% of students’ parents are satisfied with the online learning platform, and 63% of them are very satisfied. As the technology becomes more and more perfect, the quality of teaching will gradually improve in the future.",

The focus of big data applications has gradually shifted from model training to the prediction and inference. Choosing the most suitable model for enterprise application scenarios among many machine learning models has become a topic of research that has attracted much attention. Though ensemble methods have been proposed to discover best model by multiple training phase, studies of finding best combination within multiple modes are still few. Configuring different machine learning models with appropriate parameters and looking for parameters is an NP-hard problem, which requires an optimization algorithm. This study proposes a differential evolution algorithm to integrate multiple trained machine learning models into an appropriate model. In this paper, the regression model is taken as an example and the differential evolution algorithm is compared with the genetic algorithm. Three benchmark datasets are used to examine, and the results show that the differential evolution algorithm outperforms genetic algorithm.",

This, coupled with advances in geographic analysis tools, has led to a rise in epidemiologic studies on distribution of disease that rely on analysis of secondary data, e.g. from cancer registries. However, while the data and tools are available for performing geospatial analyses, there are challenges with which methodologies to apply, how to interpret and translate results, and how results are impacted by data quality. The issue of data quality is the subject of this paper.Mapping cancer rates highlights spatial patterns that can help elucidate environmental, clinical, or social causality pathways that drive differences in disease burden by geographic locations. Locating areas with high rates of cancer incidence or variations by stage at diagnoses can help prioritize cancer control efforts. Once the geographic patterns of cancer are mapped, the ideal action is to follow with effective public health interventions for the high risk communities. However, before using results of spatial research to inform public health response, it is important to consider whether the results are spurious due to methodological issues, such as data quality. Missing or incorrect data can distort research conclusions and result in ineffective public health policy.Using colorectal cancer (CRC) as an example, the impact of missing stage at diagnosis on late-stage at diagnosis cluster detection is evaluated. The impact on cluster detection, area-based modeling, and distance from services analysis is described.",

It is estimated that users spend more than 50% of their time debugging their big data applications, wasting machine resources and taking longer to reach valuable insights. One cannot simply transplant traditional debugging techniques to big data. In this paper, we propose the TagSniff model, which can dramatically simplify data debugging for dataflows (the de-facto programming model for big data). It is based on two primitives -- tag and sniff -- that are flexible and expressive enough to model all common big data debugging scenarios. We then present Snoopy -- a general purpose monitoring and debugging system based on the TagSniff model. It supports both online and post-hoc debugging modes. Our experimental evaluation shows that Snoopy incurs a very low overhead on the main dataflow, 6% on average, as well as it is highly responsive to system events and users instructions.",

Each study exploits its own tools and mechanisms to capture, store, query and analyze Twitter data. Inevitably, platforms have been developed to replace this ad-hoc exploration with a more structured and methodological form of analysis. Another body of literature focuses on developing languages for querying Tweets. This paper addresses issues around the big data nature of Twitter and emphasizes the need for new data management and query language frameworks that address limitations of existing systems. We review existing approaches that were developed to facilitate twitter analytics followed by a discussion on research issues and technical challenges in developing integrated solutions.",

In particular, a novel NVDIMM-based heterogeneous storage performance model is proposed to effectively address bus contention issues caused by placing NVDIMMs on the memory bus. We also develop an NVDIMM-based lazy migration scheme to effectively minimize adverse effects caused by memory traffic interferences during storage data management processes. Finally, the NVDIMM-based architectural support for migration optimization is proposed to increase channel parallelism in the destination NVDIMMs and bypass buffer caches in the source NVDIMMs, so that the impact of memory traffic can be alleviated. We present detailed evaluation and analysis to quantify how well our techniques can enhance the I/O performances of big workloads via efficient heterogeneous storage hierarchy management. Our experimental results show that overall the proposed techniques yield up to 98% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques.",

We are now embarking on a project to revolutionize the total system architectural stack in a holistic fashion in the Post-Moore era, from devices and hardware, abstracted by system software and programming models and languages, and optimized according to the device characteristics with new algorithms and applications that exploit them. Such systems will have multitudes of varieties according to the matching characteristics of applications to the underlying architecture, leading to what can be metaphorically described as Cambrian Explosion of computing systems. The diverse elements of such systems will be interconnected with next-generation terabit optics and networks, allowing metropolitan-scale computing infrastructure that would truly realize high performance parallel and distributed computing. However, which algorithms and applications would benefit the most from such future computing, given that some physical constants, e.g., communication latency, cannot be improved? We speculate on some of the scenarios that would change the nature of current Cloud-centric infrastructures towards the Post-Moore era.",

Nevertheless, existing storage resource management systems, such as VMware SDRS, are incapable of performing real time policy-based storage management due to the high cost of migrating large size virtual disks. Hence, the traditional storage management schemes become ineffective due to the lack of quick response to the frequent IO bursts and the inaccurate storage latency prediction in the light of a highly fluctuating environment. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose LightSRM, which can work properly in a time-variant cloud environment. To mitigate the storage migration cost, we leverage copy-on-write/read snapshots to redirect the IO requests without moving the virtual disk. To support snapshots in storage management, we also build a performance model specifically for snapshots. We employ exponentially weighted moving average with adjustable sliding window to provide quick and accurate performance prediction. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid management scheme, which can dynamically choose either snapshot or migration for fastest performance tuning. We build our prototype in a QEMU/KVM based virtualized environment. Our empirical evaluation results show that snapshot can redirect IO requests in a faster manner than migration can do when the virtual disk size is large. Besides, snapshot method has less disk performance impact on the applications. By employing hybrid snapshot/migration method, LightSRM yields less overall latency, better load balance, and less IO traffic overhead.",

We showed the following results: 1) the value metrics generated from LLA in a use case of an internet game and crowd-sourcing; 2) the results from LLA are validated and correlated with the ground truth; 3) the game-theoretic LLA can help an information provider to present the information in the most valuable way. The information presentation can solve a problem (e.g., a search request of innovation) that no other information providers can solve (i.e., expertise). In addition, it ties also to a broader context that the unique value can propagate through the consensus. Based on the game-theoretic LLA, an information provider should not always present expertise content or authoritative content but rather with a mixed strategy where each type of content is presented with certain probabilities for the best value overall.",

Over the years, three technologies have emerged most frequently, namely big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Big data and cloud computing are actually extensions and paving the way for artificial intelligence technology. Especially in today's society, with the increase of energy resources, the application of big data is more and more extensive, and in education big data is also used in it. Therefore, it is now more and more convenient for us to know the excellence and gap between universities in various countries and regions. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to study the comparative in the context of large data, Chinese and Japanese universities have the advantages and disadvantages of it education. Therefore, after consulting the relevant parties about it essence and it education, as well as the teaching background and teaching attitude of Chinese and Japanese universities, this paper integrates the information found by using big data-related algorithms, then analyzes and processes the relevant data using hierarchical bat algorithms, and then produces the experimental results we need. Experimental results show that the use of big data and hierarchical bat algorithms can better study the characteristics of it education in Chinese and Japanese universities.",

                "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our ability to collect data from various sensors, devices, in different formats, from independent or connected applications. This data flood has outpaced our capability to process, analyze, store and understand these datasets. Consider the Internet data. The web pages indexed by Google were around one million in 1998, but quickly reached 1 billion in 2000 and have already exceeded 1 trillion in 2008. This rapid expansion is accelerated by the dramatic increase in acceptance of social networking applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc., that allow users to create contents freely and amplify the already huge Web volume. Furthermore, with mobile phones becoming the sensory gateway to get real-time data on people from different aspects, the vast amount of data that mobile carrier can potentially process to improve our daily life has significantly outpaced our past CDR (call data record)- based processing for billing purposes only. It can be foreseen that Internet of things (IoT) applications will raise the scale of data to an unprecedented level. People and devices (from home coffee machines to cars, to buses, railway stations and airports) are all loosely connected. Trillions of such connected components will generate a huge data ocean, and valuable information must be discovered from the data to help improve quality of life and make our world a better place. For example, after we get up every morning, in order to optimize our commute time to work and complete the optimization before we arrive at office, the system needs to process information from traffic, weather, construction, police activities to our calendar schedules, and perform deep optimization under the tight time constraints. In all these applications, we are facing significant challenges in leveraging the vast amount of data, including challenges in (1) system capabilities (2) algorithmic design (3) business models.",

In order to realize such fine-grained economic simulations, we developed a high-performance computing extension for Agent Based Economic Models (ABEMs) and seamlessly integrated it with a physics-based earthquake disaster simulator. Due to the lack of availability of the data of each individual economic entity, we generated data for 127 million agents by disaggregating the macroeconomic data available from several Japanese government agencies. Using the generated large data set, the ABEM is validated for the Japanese economy by reproducing past observations. As a demonstrative application of the developed system, we estimate the economic impacts of a disaster in Hanshin industrial region caused by a potential Nankai-trough mega-thrust earthquake, and the disaster hit economy is compared with normal state of the economy up to a period of 3 years.",

However, experience has proven that, certain issues of using artificial intelligence require further scientific research in order to achieve a balanced and sustainable growth of the financial and economic system.Theoretical foundations of sustainable economic growth in the country have been studied. The authors have reviewed modern domestic and foreign literature on the topic and paid special attention to the issues of balanced financial and economic system and sustainable economic growth in modern conditions.We demonstrate the factors increasing risk and market uncertainty and other in order to achieve a balanced and sustainable growth of the financial system based on the AI-system \"Decision Tree\" developed.The trends in functioning of the financial and economic system have been determined; the dynamics of the balanced profit volumes in real sector organizations has been traced quarterly for the period of 2015-2018. Live data of the Federal State Statistics Service showed that the balanced financial result (profit except for loss) of organizations (apart from small business entities, banks, insurance organizations and state and municipal institutions) in current prices decreased by 8.5% in 2017.In order to visualize the dynamics of the effective factor - GDP a neural network model \"AI-quantization of data\" has been developed.In order to achieve a balanced and sustainable growth of the financial system based on the AI-system \"Decision Tree\" developed.",

As the volume, variety, velocity, and variability of data grows, we need more efficient data analysis methods that can scale towards increasingly large and high dimensional data sets. We develop a streaming clustering algorithm that is highly amenable to hardware acceleration. Our algorithm eliminates the need to store the data objects, which removes limits on the size of the data that we can analyze. Our algorithm is highly parameterizable, which allows it to fit to the characteristics of the data set, and scale towards the available hardware resources. Our streaming hardware core can handle more than 40 Msamples/s when processing 3-dimensional streaming data and up to 1.78 Msamples/s for 70-dimensional data. To validate the accuracy and performance of our algorithms we compare it with several common clustering techniques on several different applications. The experimental result shows that it outperforms other prior hardware accelerated clustering systems.",

                "abstract": "Most research has proposed scalable and parallel analytic algorithms that work outside a DBMS. On the other hand, R has become a very popular system to perform machine learning analysis, but it is limited by main memory and single-threaded processing. Recently, novel columnar DBMSs have shown to provide orders of magnitude improvement in SQL query processing speed, preserving the parallel speedup of row-based parallel DBMSs. With that motivation in mind, we present COLUMNAR, a system integrating a parallel columnar DBMS and R, that can directly compute models on large data sets stored as relational tables. Our algorithms are based on a combination of SQL queries, user-defined functions (UDFs) and R calls, where SQL queries and UDFs compute data set summaries that are sent to R to compute models in RAM. Since our hybrid algorithms exploit the DBMS for the most demanding computations involving the data set, they show linear scalability and are highly parallel. Our algorithms generally require one pass on the data set or a few passes otherwise (i.e. fewer passes than traditional methods). Our system can analyze data sets faster than R even when they fit in RAM and it also eliminates memory limitations in R when data sets exceed RAM size. On the other hand, it is an order of magnitude faster than Spark (a prominent Hadoop system) and a traditional row-based DBMS.",

SDS is designed to be easy to implement and sustain over time by building on existing tool chains and proven open-source software and by minimizing bespoke code and domain-specific customization.

                "abstract": "The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the main programing language designed to manage data stored in database systems. While SQL was initially used only with relational database management systems (RDBMS), its use has been significantly extended with the advent of new types of database systems. Specifically, SQL has been found to be a powerful query language in highly distributed and scalable systems that process Big Data, i.e., datasets with high volume, velocity and variety. While traditional relational databases represent now only a small fraction of the database systems landscape, most database courses that cover SQL consider only the use of SQL in the context of traditional relational systems. In this paper, we propose teaching SQL as a general language that can be used in a broad range of database systems from traditional RDBMSs to Big Data systems. This paper presents well-structured guidelines to introduce SQL in the context of new types of database systems including MapReduce, NoSQL and NewSQL. A key contribution of this paper is the description of an array of course resources, e.g., virtual machines, sample projects, and in-class exercises, to enable a hands-on experience with SQL across a broad set of modern database systems.",

But, there is very little research on the inner relationship among vocational skill based on big data. To address the issue, from LinkedIn we first collect tens of thousands of member profiles with vocational skills as empirical data. And then, we dig out high-frequency vocational skills and apply correlation analysis method to explore correlation characteristics of vocational skills. According to our studying, we figure out that there exist a large number of association rules, some of which have very high degrees of confidence, lift, and support. This research reveals the intrinsic association among different vocational skills. These relationships can reflect the general behavior and cognitive rules of human beings. We hope that our research results can provide a theoretical base for other research areas of vocational skills, such as vocational skill training, vocational skill mining, and identification of vocational skills.",

Application-oriented universities are responsible for carrying out statistics teaching reform so that students can meet the needs of talents in the big data era. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the problem, i.e., update the educational concept and reform the teaching mode. This paper analyzed the influential factors of the big data era on statistics courses and rethought the existing problems in statistics teaching from the perspective of teachers and students. To cultivate versatile big data talents, a new teaching model was proposed. The new model contains six dimensions, i.e., statistical thinking, teaching content, teaching mode & method, students’ participation, course assessment, and teacher training. The teaching effect shows that the new model effectively stimulates students’ initiative, and cultivates their statistical thinking and statistical application ability. Moreover, it promotes them to master statistical knowledge better.",

Data quality plays a critical role in a data-intensive, knowledge-based economy. The objective of this study is to identify the most important factors for accounting information quality and their impact on AIS data quality outcomes. The article includes an extensive literature review and summarizes studies in quality management, data quality, accounting information systems, and enterprise planning in helping to identify a set of critical success factors for data quality. The study uses empirical data to answer the research question and test the research hypothesis. Study results show that the top three most important factors that affect accounting information systems’ data quality are top management commitment, the nature of the accounting information systems (such as the suitability of the systems), and input controls. The article further uses regression analysis to test the effect of those factors on AIS data quality, finding that there is a significant positive relationship between the perceived performance of the three most important factors and perceived AIS data quality outcomes.",

A cornerstone task in these applications is discovering a suitable service that meets the threshold of some user needs. Then, those services can be composed to perform specific functionalities. We argue that the prevailing approach to compose services based on the \"all or nothing\" paradigm is limiting and leads to exceedingly high rejection of potentially suitable services. Furthermore, contemporary models do not allow \"mix and match\" composition from atomic services of different composite services when binary matching is not possible or desired. In this paper, we propose a new model for service composition based on \"stratified graph summarization\" and \"service stitching\". We discuss the limitations of existing approaches with a motivating example, present our approach to overcome these limitations, and outline a possible architecture for service composition from atomic services. Our thesis is that, with the advent of Big Data, our approach will reduce latency in service discovery, and will improve efficiency and accuracy of matchmaking and composition of services.",

Data scientists can use Stat! to quickly refine to the correct query, while getting immediate feedback after processing a fraction of the data. Stat! can work with multiple processing engines in the backend; in this demo, we use Stat! with the Microsoft StreamInsight streaming engine. StreamInsight is used to generate incremental early results to queries and refine these results as more data is processed. Stat! allows data scientists to explore data, dynamically compose multiple queries to generate streams of partial results, and display partial results in both textual and visual form.",

In recent years, the rapid development of big data(BD) technology has brought new opportunities for all aspects of economic and social development, and the transformation and change of traditional management mode have happened quietly. How to apply BD technology and thinking to the innovation of VE management mode and solve the dilemma of VE management is a major issue we are facing. Based on this, this paper studies the innovation and development of VE management mode under the background of BD. In this paper, by referring to the BD software statistical analysis data, access to a large number of Chinese and English literature and information, query the data of China's VE, comparative study. This paper uses the methods of digital comparison, literature analysis and historical research. At the same time, the use of management, education, economics and other disciplinary knowledge, theoretical analysis, to achieve the unity of theory and reality. In addition, this paper also makes a questionnaire survey and Analysis on the development of VE management mode, and evaluates the status of VE management mode under the background of BD from three different aspects of VE management methods, management mode and enforceability. The results show that under the background of BD, 25% of the teachers and students think that the resource utilization rate of the current VE management mode is low, and 37% of the teachers and students think that there is a situation of repeated construction of resources. Therefore, in the context of BD, there are still some problems in the management mode of VE, and the innovative research on the management mode of VE is of great value to solve the above problems.",

As the most widely used electric energy, it will usher in a new epoch-making generation of electric power technology revolution including \" big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, mobile Internet, artificial intelligence and blockchain \" in the Industry 4.0 era. The new application of these new technologies in the power scene will bring many improvements to the power system, including expanding the enterprise value boundary, improving customer experience, reducing service costs, improving service quality, and promoting the transformation of enterprises. However, because these technologies themselves have certain technical loopholes, and the integration with the huge power grid system will also bring more threats. So we need to carefully study and analyze how to better apply new technologies in the power grid. This paper introduces the current development of these technologies and lists the application scenarios of their integration with the grid system. The hidden dangers that may be brought by the application of these new technologies in the power grid system are introduced, and corresponding solutions are proposed.",

However, as the difficulty of the scientific problem increases, the amount of data and the number of tasks required for FFS is challenging to manage with traditional scripting tools and languages for high performance computing. The SAFFIRE software framework has been developed to address these challenges. SAFFIRE utilizes Hadoop to manage a large number of tasks and data for large scale FFS simulations. The framework is shown to be highly scalable and able to support large scale FFS simulations. This enables studies of rare events in complex molecular systems on commodity cluster computing systems.",

First, how to infer real-time air quality of any arbitrary location given environmental data and historical air quality data from very sparse monitoring locations. Second, if one needs to establish few new monitoring stations to improve the inference quality, how to determine the best locations for such purpose? The problems are challenging since for most of the locations (>99%) in a city we do not have any air quality data to train a model from. We design a semi-supervised inference model utilizing existing monitoring data together with heterogeneous city dynamics, including meteorology, human mobility, structure of road networks, and point of interests (POIs). We also propose an entropy-minimization model to suggest the best locations to establish new monitoring stations. We evaluate the proposed approach using Beijing air quality data, resulting in clear advantages over a series of state-of-the-art and commonly used methods.",

Such an analytical determination is important to make, given the increasing availability of gigabit-speed Internet connections, along with the explosive growth in data-transfer speeds supported by newer editions of drive interfaces such as SAS and PCI Express.

Correcting values in tuples is typically performed by a minimum cost repair of tuples that violate static constraints like Conditional Functional Dependencies (which have to be provided by domain experts or learned from a clean sample of the database). In this article, we provide a method for correcting individual attribute values in a structured database using a Bayesian generative model and a statistical error model learned from the noisy database directly. We thus avoid the necessity for a domain expert or clean master data. We also show how to efficiently perform consistent query answering using this model over a dirty database, in case write permissions to the database are unavailable. We evaluate our methods over both synthetic and real data.",

However, there have been a lack of studies on improving the satisfaction of civil services that address the needs and demands of newly migrated inhabitants. In this study, we conducted a big data analysis of the city of Namyangju, an exemplary 'smart city' in Korea, from 2009 to 2016, regarding the change in population composition by the influx of new migrants and its effect on the civil service complaints. According to the results of this study, there was a statistical significance between the increase of civil service complaints and the change of migrants by age group. This suggests that the preference for civil services is different for each life-cycle stage. Moreover, the increase in the demands of civil services was different between the migrants within and from outside of Namyangju. This means that there is an expectancy disconfirmation depending on how many civil services are previously experienced. The results of this analysis also suggest the policy implications on the role of local government, to implement smart city policy for the enhancement of quality of life of a city.",

                "abstract": "With the advancement of the scientific concept of development, the concept of sustainable development of ecological environment has gradually become popular. Natural ecology provides us with a variety of resources, which is our living environment. However, with the rapid growth of population and the continuous construction of economic, social and urban development, the chemical pollution of agricultural development has caused serious damage to the land ecological environment. In order to realize the sustainable utilization of natural resources(NR), green and healthy development of ecological environment, and reduce the pollution of agricultural environment, the research and Realization of the sustainable development and utilization of NR and environment is urgent. This paper mainly studies the coupling dynamic model of natural resource environment and agricultural environmental pollution(AEP) based on big data. Based on the interaction between natural environment and environmental pollution, this paper designs and studies the coupling dynamic model of natural resource environment and AEP, studies and discusses the balance between them, and uses the data analysis method to prove the damage of AEP to the natural environment. In this paper, the establishment method of dynamic model is expounded, the coupling dynamic model of NR environment and AEP is established, the causes of AEP are analyzed, and the corresponding coupling dynamic model is established. Based on the big data, this paper selects the pollution data of agricultural environment plate in the simulation test, and makes a reasonable analysis of the data. The experimental study shows that AEP causes great damage to natural environmental resources. In farmland, orchard, vegetable garden and other places where agricultural resources are highly utilized, the pH value and TN value of land are extremely high, and even the SS concentration in runoff is as high as 289mg / L, and the COD concentration is as high as 235mg / L.",

In this paper we present some of the challenges that we face in managing and maintaining data quality for a terabyte scale biometrics repository. We have developed a step by step model to capture, ingest, validate, and prepare data for biometrics research. During these processes, there are many hidden errors which can be introduced into the data. Those errors can affect the overall quality of data, and thus can skew the results of biometrics research.

These cross many research communities including distributed systems, databases, cyberphysical systems and parallel computing which sometimes have inconsistent worldviews. There are many common capabilities across these systems which are often implemented differently in each packaged environment. For example, communication can be bulk synchronous processing or data flow; scheduling can be dynamic or static; state and fault-tolerance can have different models; execution and data can be streaming or batch, distributed or local. We suggest that one can usefully build a toolkit (called Twister2 by us) that supports these different choices and allows fruitful customization for each application area. We illustrate the design of Twister2 by several point studies. We stress the many open questions in very traditional areas including scheduling, messaging and checkpointing.",

                "abstract": "Today's organizations, including online businesses, use the art of data-driven decision-making i.e. business-intelligence (BI) to benefit from all the data out in the open. Given the current market demand for BI skill-sets, including the knowledge of different sources and tools for data-collection plus processing, today's youth need a basic understanding of data-driven intelligence, and an awareness of big-data related ethics and privacy. However, there has been limited research and development work towards designing an effective educational module in this regard at the K-12 level. We intend to address this particular limitation by presenting a uniquely engaging middle-school learning module based upon a combination of useful topics, like data-mining, predictive-analytics, data-visualization, big-data, ethics and privacy, using the free RapidMiner software-tool. The novelty of our module lies in the use of a GUI-based visual hands-on platform (RapidMiner), a Hollywood movie-theme based educational activity, as well as an added focus on big-data ethics and privacy, and its conceptual mapping to the NSA-GenCyber security-first principles. We discuss and analyze the survey data obtained from over hundred participants through several offerings of our module as an educational workshop through our Google-IgniteCS and NSA-GenCyber programs. The collected learning-analytics data indicate that our module can become a simple yet effective means for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethical and privacy issues, and GenCyber security-first principles at the middle-school level. Our results show prospects of motivating middle-school participants towards further learning of topics in data-science, data-ethics and data-security, which is necessary today in a variety of professions.",

This article applies the method of internet big data to construct the indicator of digital strategic transformation, and uses the micro-data of China's new third board listed companies to study the impact of digital strategic transformation on the innovation performance of high-tech SMEs. The empirical result shows that the digital strategic transformation can significantly helps to promote the innovation performance of high-tech SMEs. To overcome the measurement errors of endogenous problems or missing variables in empirical model, a series of robustness tests are conducted. The results are still valid after replacing enterprise innovation indicators, and using different regression models. Based on this, the construction of digital infrastructure should play a more active role in the process of data management and knowledge innovation of high-tech SMEs.",

Federal law governing student privacy and the release of student records suggests that anonymizing student data protects student privacy. Guided by this standard, we de-identified and released a data set from 16 MOOCs (massive open online courses) from MITx and HarvardX on the edX platform. In this article, we show that these and other de-identification procedures necessitate changes to data sets that threaten replication and extension of baseline analyses. To balance student privacy and the benefits of open data, we suggest focusing on protecting privacy without anonymizing data by instead expanding policies that compel researchers to uphold the privacy of the subjects in open data sets. If we want to have high-quality social science research and also protect the privacy of human subjects, we must eventually have trust in researchers. Otherwise, we’ll always have the strict tradeoff between anonymity and science illustrated here.",

                "abstract": "As increasing the massive amount of data demands effective and efficient mining strategies, practitioners and researchers are trying to develop scalable mining algorithms, machine learning algorithms and strategies to be successful data mining in turning mountains of data into nuggets. Data of high dimension significantly increases the memory storage requirements and computational costs for data analytics. Therefore, reducing dimension can mainly improve three data mining performance: speed of learning, predictive accuracy and simplicity and comprehensibility of mined result. Feature selection, data preprocessing technique, is effective and efficient in data mining, data analytics and machine learning problems particularly in high dimension reduction. Most feature selection algorithms can eliminate only irrelevant features but redundant features. Not only irrelevant features but also redundant features can degrade learning performance. Mutual information measured feature selection is proposed in this work to remove both irrelevant and redundant features.",

This article mainly studies the classification and mining algorithm of e-commerce big data based on BP neural network technology. Take user movie rating data as the object of analysis and mining, and use platform functions to complete the whole process of data from preprocessing to data mining to result data storage. According to the requirements of the platform design modules and functions, the construction process from the installation of the cluster dependent tool software, node communication, cluster configuration to the final operation monitoring was completed, and the experimental environment of the e-commerce big data platform was established. According to the real open source movie rating data, according to the BP neural network algorithm, relying on the function of the module, the whole recommendation task from data processing, algorithm mining to the final result generation is completed. Through the comparison of speedup, accuracy, recall and coverage indicators, it can be seen that when the experimental data set is 100K, the recommendation efficiency in the cluster environment is not improved. The results show that the BP neural network improves the efficiency of the e-commerce big data platform and the accuracy of task execution results.",

                "abstract": "To analyze large-scale data efficiently, developers have created various big data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark). These big data processing frameworks provide abstractions to developers so that they can focus on implementing the data analysis logic. In traditional software systems, developers leverage logging to monitor applications and record intermediate states to assist workload understanding and issue diagnosis. However, due to the abstraction and the peculiarity of big data frameworks, there is currently no effective monitoring approach for big data applications. In this paper, we first manually study 1,000 randomly sampled Spark-related questions on Stack Overflow to study their root causes and the type of information, if recorded, that can assist developers with motioning and diagnosis. Then, we design an approach, DPLOG, which assists developers with monitoring Spark applications. DPLOG leverages statistical sampling to minimize performance overhead and provides intermediate information and hint/warning messages for each data processing step of a chained method pipeline. We evaluate DPLOG on six benchmarking programs and find that DPLOG has a relatively small overhead (i.e., less than 10% increase in response time when processing 5GB data) compared to without using DPLOG, and reduce the overhead by over 500% compared to the baseline. Our user study with 20 developers shows that DPLOG can reduce the needed time to debug big data applications by 63% and the participants give DPLOG an average of 4.85/5 for its usefulness. The idea of DPLOG may be applied to other big data processing frameworks, and our study sheds light on future research opportunities in assisting developers with monitoring big data applications.",
