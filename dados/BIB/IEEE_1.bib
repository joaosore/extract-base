Also they are a fact that both industry and scientific research needs to deal with. They are interesting from analytical point of view, for they contain knowledge that cannot be ignored and left unused. Traditional system that supports the advanced analytics and knowledge extraction -- data warehouse -- is not able to cope with large amounts of fast incoming various and unstructured data, and may be facing a paradigm shift in terms of utilized concepts, technologies and methodologies, which have become a very active research area in the last few years. This paper provides an overview of research trends important for the big data warehousing, concepts and technologies used for data storage and (ETL) processing, and research approaches done in attempts to empower traditional data warehouses for handling big data.",

Socioeconomic development has become a hot topic for academia, industries, organizations, and governments. This paper will examine big data-driven socioeconomic development from a strategic perspective. More specifically, this paper explores the importance of big data by looking at the big characteristics (10 Bigs) of big data. This paper presents a GDDP (gross domestic data products) as a GDP-like data metric for measuring economic performance and social progress. It proposes a strategic model for big data-driven socioeconomic development, which is supported by big data-driven technologies, services, economies, and societies. This research demonstrates that big data-driven SMACS (i.e., social, mobile, analytics, cloud, and service) technologies, services, economies, and societies underpin the big data-driven socioeconomic development. The proposed approach in this paper might facilitate the research and development of big data, big data analytics, socioeconomic development, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital society.",

We choose Big Data, one influential and representative Chinese academic journal as our data source, and download the bibliographic data of 195 articles published in the past three years on this journal from CNKI. In order to gain the general overview of Chinese big data research status quo, we count the high frequency words and distribution of publish years. From the high frequency words list, we can tell that the times of mentions of \"data\" is far more than that of other frequency words, which verifies the fact that data is the most important concept in big data research. In order to extract the hot topics of big data research, we adopt LDA model to generate topics of the 195 research articles. With several experiments, we set the topic number as seven for the best outcome quality. With expert suggestion, we label the seven topics as \"Big data helps government decisions\", \"Internet and management\",\" Artificial intelligence helps public security\",\" Big data promotes information\", \"Big data governance\", \"Artificial intelligence and 5G\",\" Big data prediction\" based on the high frequency words in each topic. Most of the topic labels are linked to 5G, artificial intelligence and other modern techniques, which implies that the big data plays a necessary role in empowering the future techniques. We hope this paper could contribute to further big data research in China.",

This amount of data is increasing at a rapid pace. The collection of this huge amount of data leads to challenges of storage, analysis, etc. Since, processing this huge amount of data is a challenge for learning algorithms of Artificial Intelligence (machine learning), therefore, in this paper, we target the Sampling of data in big data paradigm. We analyze, how and what will be the role of sampling the training data so that machine algorithms are able to rapidly and precisely build a training model from this huge amount of data. The data normally represents some model. Since, it is extremely difficult to learn a pattern or a model from huge data (precisely and quickly). Thus, this paper studies and analyzes the role of sampling in data sets. Though our data sets cover only specific areas, the training data is objectively similar in nature for machine learning algorithms. We concentrate on how sampling will play its role in specific fields of Artificial Intelligence, i.e., training and testing paradigm and in real time as well. From the experimental analysis, we observe that re-sampling the data has a very slight impact on the over-all classification performance. However, it has greater impact of the execution time as seen from experimental results. Finally, we believe the results in this paper should be viewed as indicative for future research rather than conclusive.",

The development of big data analysis technology provides technical opportunities for campuses to accurately identify poor students. This article first makes full use of the campus card consumption data to establish a poverty indicator system. Due to the large number of indicators, it also screens the indicators based on PCA. Then combined the adaboosting algorithm and the logistic regression algorithm to construct a poor student identification model, obtain the poverty support rate and poverty probability of each student, calculate the student's poverty index, classify the poverty level of the students, and determine the real poor students. Finally, the validity of the model is verified by the consumption data of a college student card in 2019. This method helps to improve the accuracy of poor students' recognition, thereby effectively improving the management level of students.",

The authors are a multi-disciplinary team of invited researchers and stakeholders who participated in this breakout session. This report includes an overview of our discussions on the many research challenges associated with sensemaking within a big data environment. Specifically, we focused on key topics that fit squarely in the intersection of the sensemaking and big data research, as other communities already exist for decision making and big data technologies independently. As part of this effort, our group developed and proposed a framework around which this community can target and structure future research. This framework is intended to allow the community to systematically identify areas where innovative research might make large contributions to sensemaking in a big data environment.",

Big data analytic systems, thus, have been popular to derive important decision making in various areas. However, visualization on analytic system faces various limitation due to the huge amount of data. This brings the necessity of interactive visualization techniques beyond the traditional static visualization. R has been used and improved for a big data analysis and mining tool. Also, R is supported with various and abundant packages for different targets with visualization. However interactive visualization packages are not easily found in the market. This paper compares and analyzes interactive web packages with visualization packages for R. This paper also proposes interactive web visualized analysis environment for big data with a combination of interactive web packages and visualization packages. In particular, Big data analysis techniques with sensed data are presented as the result by reflecting the decision view on sensing field.",

In this paper, we focus on applying optical networking techniques for supporting the big data transfer between datacenters. In particular, we propose a green optical networking scheme, namely predictive and incremental grooming (PI-grooming), which makes the traffic grooming decision based on the existing flow assignment, the current traffic demands, and the expected future traffic demands to achieve energy-efficient communication. We conduct large-scale simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed PI-grooming scheme. The results show that PI-grooming can save energy by up to 25% compared to existing baseline solutions.",

The purpose of this paper is to make a clear case for concern regarding the seriousness of keeping data private while facilitating efforts to encourage and support emerging technologies. This investigative process included the pursuit of relevant articles and published works that provided a clear and relevant picture of the current state of affairs concerning Big Data and privacy. After a review of the literature, an analysis of data collection methods, a discovery of Big Data processes and purposes, and the identification of risks pertaining to the individual, the military, and the country, it was determined that significant concerns do exist pertaining to data collection, Big Data, and privacy. These concerns not only pertain to the individual, but with military effectiveness and national security.",

There is need to understand how to benchmark systems used to build AI based solutions that have a complex pipeline of pre-processing, statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning on data to build prediction models. Solution architects, engineers and researchers may use open-source technology or proprietary systems based on desired performance requirements. The performance metrics may be data pre-processing time, model training time and model inference time. We do not see a single benchmark answering all questions of solution architects and researchers. This tutorial covers both practical and research questions on relevant Big Data and Analytics benchmarks.",

The system is implemented on the web and we utilize Spring Framework for distributed processing with consideration to scalability. Furthermore, we have collected epidemic disease data from a public data repository that the government opens to the public and we analyze the data to reveal the causality of disease outbreak through our system.",
